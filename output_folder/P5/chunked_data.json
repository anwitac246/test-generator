In general, a wave also transports energy and momentum (in addition to oscillations of y). Thus, in a wave, the following three physical quantities transfer from one point to another point. (i) oscillations of y (ii) energy and (iii) momentum In different situations, the physical quantity y may be different. For example: y is displacement of medium particles (between + A and \u2212A) from the mean position in case of string wave, where A is the amplitude of oscillations. Similarly, y is electric and magnetic fields for electromagnetic waves and it is displacement, pressure and density which oscillate in longitudinal (or sound) wave. A wave is said to be travelling or progressive if it travels from one point to another. A plane wave is a wave of constant frequency and amplitude with wavefronts that are infinitely long straight lines. Plane waves travel in the perpendicular direction to the wavefronts. Many physical waves are approximate plane waves far from their sources. 17.2 Classification of a Wave A wave can be classified in the following three manners : 1-D, 2-D and 3-D Wave In 1-D wave, oscillations of y (or energy and momentum also) transfer in a straight line or we can say that wave travels in a straight line. String wave is the best example of a 1-D wave. In 2-D wave, it travels in a plane. Wave travelling on the surface of water is an example of a 2-D wave. In 3-D wave, it travels in whole space. Sound or light wave produced by a point source is an example of a 3-D wave. Transverse and Longitudinal Wave In transverse waves, oscillations of y are perpendicular to wave velocity and wave velocity is the direction in which oscillations (or energy and momentum) transfer from one point to another. Electromagnetic waves and string waves are transverse in nature.In longitudinal waves, oscillations are along the wave velocity. Sound wave is a longitudinal wave. 2 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics Transverse wave Mean position Wave motion Oscillation Mean position Oscillation Longitudinal wave Fig. 17.1  Extra Points to Remember Mechanical and Non-mechanical Wave The waves which require medium for their propagation from one point to another point are called mechanical waves. Although this medium may be a gas also. Sound wave is a mechanical wave. Over the moon, sound waves cannot travel, as there is no gas on its surface. Non-mechanical waves can travel with or without medium. Electromagnetic waves are non-mechanical waves. \u0098 Apart from mechanical and non-mechanical waves, there is also another kind of waves called \u2018\u2018matter waves\u2019\u2019. \u0098 Sound wave is basically a part of longitudinal waves with frequency varying from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. Similarly, light wave is a part of electromagnetic waves with wavelength varying from approximately 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5. \u0098 In the propagation of mechanical waves, elasticity and inertia of the medium play an important role. \u0098 Waves traveling through a solid medium can be either transverse or longitudinal waves. But waves travelling through a fluid (such as a liquid or a gas) are always longitudinal waves. Transverse waves require a relatively rigid medium in order to transmit their energy. As one particle begins to move it must be able to exert a pull on its nearest neighbor. If the medium is not rigid as is the case with fluids, the particles will slide past each other. This sliding action that is characteristic of liquids and gases prevents one particle from displacing its neighbour in a direction perpendicular to wave direction. It is for this reason that only longitudinal waves are observed moving through the bulk of liquids such as our ocean. \u0098 While waves that travel within the depths of the ocean are longitudinal waves, the waves that travel along the surface of the oceans are referred to as surface waves. A surface wave is a wave in which particles of the medium undergo a circular motion. Surface waves are neither longitudinal nor transverse. The radius of the circles decreases as the depth into the water increases. \u0098 Earthquakes are capable of producing both types of waves transverse as well as longitudinal. The P-waves (Primary waves) in an earthquake are examples of longitudinal waves. The P-waves travel with the fastest velocity and are the first to arrive. The S-waves (Secondary waves) in an earthquake are examples of transverse waves. S-waves propagate with a velocity slower than P-waves, arriving several seconds later. 17.3 Equation of a Travelling Wave As we have already read, in a wave motion a physical quantity y is made to oscillate at one point and these oscillations of y propagate to other places also. Therefore, in a wave, several particles oscillate (unlike SHM in which normally a single oscillates). So, to determine the value of y (from its mean position between +A and \u2212A) we will have to tell position of the particle and time. Thus, y f = (position of particle, time) In three dimensional space, position of the particle can be represented by three variable co-ordinates. Thus, in general, y is a function of four variables, three in co-ordinates and the fourth one is time. But in physics, we normally keep least number of variables. If the wave is one-dimensional, then position of the particle can be represented by a single variable co-ordinate (say x). Chapter 17 Wave Motion \u0097 3  Thus, in a one-dimensional wave y is a function of two variables x and t. Here, x is used for position of the particle and t for time or y f x t = ( , ) Note Since, there are two variables in y, therefore whenever required, y is always differentiated partially. For example, \u2202 \u2202 y x, \u2202 \u2202 y t , \u2202 \u2202 2 2 y x etc. Now, the question is, there may be infinite number of functions of x and t, like y x t = + y xt t x = + 3 2 etc Obviously, all functions will not represent a wave function. Only those functions of x and t will represent a wave function which satisfies the following three conditions. Condition 1 The given function must satisfy the following differential equation : \u2202 \u2202 \u2202 \u2202 2 2 2 2 y t k y x \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7= \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u2026(i) Here, k is a constant which is equal to square of the wave velocity or k v = 2 Condition 2 The wave function must be single valued. For given values of x and t there should be only one value of y. Condition 3 The wave function and its first derivative must be continuous. Therefore, there should not be a sudden change in the value of y and its first derivative (in some cases it will be called slope). Note Last two conditions are slightly difficult to explain at this stage. So, students need not to go in detail of those. The general solution of Eq. (i) discussed above is of the form : y x t f ax bt ( , ) ( ) = \u00b1 \u2026(ii) Thus, any function of x and t which satisfies Eq. (i) and which can be written as Eq. (ii) represents a wave, provided conditions (2) and (3) are also satisfied. Further, if these conditions are satisfied, then speed of wave (v) is given by v t x b a = = coefficient of coefficient of If ax and bt are of same sign (both positive or both negative), then wave will be travelling along negative x-direction. If one is positive and other is negative, then wave travels in negative x-direction. 4 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Alternate Method of Understanding the Wave Equation Let us consider a long string with one end fixed to a wall and the other held by a person. The person pulls on the string keeping it tight. Suppose the person snaps his hand a little up and down producing a bump in the string near his hand. Experiments shows that, as time passes the bump travels on the string towards right. Suppose the man starts snapping his hand at time t = 0and finishes his job at t t = \u2206. The vertical displacement yof the left end of the string is a function of time. y = 0 for t < 0 and t t > \u2206 y \u22600 for 0 < < t t \u2206 Let us represent this function by f t( ). Thus, y x t f t ( , ) ( ) = = 0 Here, x = 0 is the extreme left end of the string. The disturbance travels on the string towards right with a constant speed v. Thus, the displacement produced at the left end at time t, reaches the point x at time t x v + . But the displacement of the particle at point x at time t was originated at x = 0 at time t x v \u2212 . \u2234 y x t y x t x v f t x v ( , ) , = = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 0 Thus, y x t f t x v ( , ) = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2026(iii) Eq. (iii) represents a wave travelling in the positive x-direction with a constant speed v. The time t and the position x must appear in the wave equation in the combination t x v \u2212 . If the wave travels in the negative x-direction, its general equation may be written as y x t f t x v ( , ) = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 Note In the wave equation, y x t f t x v = = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ( , ) Coefficient of t is 1 and coefficient of x is 1 v . \u2234 wave speed coefficient of t coefficient of x = = = 1 1( / ) v v Chapter 17 Wave Motion \u0097 5 Fig. 17.2  V Example 17.1 In a wave motion y a kx t = sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 , y can represent: (JEE 1999) (a) electric field (b) magnetic field (c) displacement (d) pressure Solution ( , , , ) a b c d In case of sound wave, y can represent pressure and displacement, while in the case of electromagnetic wave, it represents electric and magnetic fields. V Example 17.2 Show that the equation, y a t kx = sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 satisfies the wave equation \u2202 \u2202 = \u2202 \u2202 2 2 2 2 2 y t v y x . Find speed of wave and the direction in which it is travelling. Solution \u2202 \u2202 = 2 2 2 y t a t kx \u2013 sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 \u03c9 and \u2202 \u2202 = 2 2 2 y x k a t kx \u2013 sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 We can write these two equations as \u2202 \u2202 = \u22c5\u2202 \u2202 2 2 2 2 2 2 y t k y x \u03c9 Comparing this with, \u2202 \u2202 = \u2202 \u2202 2 2 2 2 2 y t v y x We get wave speed v k = \u03c9 Ans. The negative sign between \u03c9t and kx implies that wave is travelling along positive x-direction. 1. Prove that the equation y a t = sin \u03c9 does not satisfy the wave equation and hence it does not represent a wave. 2. A wave pulse is described by y x t ae bx ct ( , ) , \u2013 ( \u2013 ) = 2 where a b , and c are positive constants. What is the speed of this wave? 3. You have learnt that a travelling wave in one dimension is represented by a function y f x t = ( , ) where x andt must appear in the combinationax bt \u00b1 or x vt \u2212 or x vt + , i.e. y f x vt = \u00b1 ( ).Is the converse true? Examine if the following functions for y can possibly represent a travelling wave (a) ( ) x vt \u2212 2 (b) log [( )/ ] x vt x + 0 (c) 1/( ) x vt + 4. The equation of a wave travelling on a string stretched along the X -axis is given by y Ae x a t T = \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 (a) Write the dimensions of A, a and T. (b) Find the wave speed. (c) In which direction is the wave travelling? (d) Where is the maximum of the pulse located at t T = and at t T =2 ? 6 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 17.1  17.4 Sine Wave If oscillations of yare simple harmonic in nature, then y x t ( , )function is sine or cosine function. Such type of wave is called sine wave or sinusoidal wave. For better understanding, we can visualize a sine wave travelling on a string. The general expression of a sine wave is y A t kx = \u00b1 \u00b1 sin ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 and y A t kx = \u00b1 \u00b1 cos ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 In the above equations, (i) A is the amplitude of oscillations of y. (ii) \u03c9 is called the angular frequency. Here, \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c0 = = 2 2 f T and f T = 1 where, f is normal frequency of oscillations and T is the time period of oscillations. SI unit of \u03c9 is radian/sec while that of f is Hz or s \u22121. (iii) k is called the angular wave number, where k = 2\u03c0 \u03bb Here, \u03bb is the wavelength of wave. Wavelength ( ) \u03bb In a transverse wave motion, the particles of the medium oscillate about their mean or equilibrium position at right angles to the direction of propagation of wave motion itself. This form of wave motion travels in the form of crests and troughs, for example, waves travelling along a stretched string. The distance between two successive crests or troughs is known as wavelength( ) \u03bb of the wave. In a longitudinal wave motion, particles of the medium oscillate about their mean or equilibrium position along the direction of propagation of the wave motion itself. This type of wave motion travels in the form of compressions and rarefactions. The distance between two successive compressions or rarefactions constitute one wavelength. Chapter 17 Wave Motion \u0097 7 Crest Trough \u03bb \u03bb Oscillation Mean position Wave motion Fig. 17.3 \u03bb \u03bb Mean position Wave motion Oscillations Fig. 17.4  Note Numerically, k = 2\u03c0 \u03bb or angular wave number is defined as the number of waves in 2\u03c0 length. Similarly, there is one another word called wave number. This is equal to 1 \u03bb and numerically this is equal to number of waves in unit length. (iv) Wave speed v, = coefficient of coefficient of t x \u2234 v k = \u03c9 But \u03c9 \u03c0 = 2 f and k = 2\u03c0 \u03bb Substituting in the above equation, we also get v f = \u03bb (v) \u2202 \u2202 y t is SHM velocity of the particle executing oscillations (lying between +\u03c9A and \u2212\u03c9A). Similarly, \u2202 \u2202 2 2 y t is SHM acceleration (lying between +\u03c92 A and \u2212\u03c92 A). Let us take an example:  suppose a sine wave travelling on a string is y A t kx = \u2212 + sin( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 \u2026(i) Then, \u2202 \u2202 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c6 y t A t kx = \u2212 + cos ( ) \u2026(ii) and \u2202 \u2202\u03c4 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c6 2 2 2 y A t kx = \u2212 \u2212 + sin ( ) \u2026(iii) From Eq. (i), we can determine y-displacement of SHM of any particle at position x and at time t. Value of y lies between + A and \u2212A. From Eq. (ii), we can determine \u2202 \u2202 y t or SHM velocity and from Eq. (iii), we can find \u22022 2 y t\u2202 or SHM acceleration. Angle ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 t kx \u2212 + is same in all three equations which is also called phase angle of three functions. With the help of this phase angle, we can determine values of y, \u2202 \u2202 y t and \u2202 \u2202 2 y t 2 at any position x at time t. If we put x = 0 and t = 0, then this angle is only \u03c6. This is called initial phase angle of the particle at co-ordinate x = 0. With the help of this angle, we can find the initial values of y y t , \u2202 \u2202 and \u2202 \u2202 2 y t 2 of this string particle (which is executing SHM at position x = 0). 8 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  \u0098 Alternate expressions of a sine wave travelling along positive x -direction are y A k x vt A kx t = \u2212 = \u2212 sin ( ) sin ( ) \u03c9 = \u2212 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 A x vt A x t T sin ( ) sin 2 2 \u03c0 \u03bb \u03c0 \u03bb Similarly, the expression, y A k x vt A kx t = + = + sin ( ) sin ( ) \u03c9 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 A x t T sin . 2 \u03c0 \u03bb etc represent a sine wave travelling along negative x-direction. \u0098 Difference between two equations y A kx t = \u2212 sin( ) \u03c9 and y A t kx = \u2212 sin( ) \u03c9 It hardly matters whether we write the first or the second equation. Both the equations represent a wave travelling in positive x-direction with speed v k = \u22c5 \u03c9 The difference between them is that they are out of phase, i.e. phase difference between them is \u03c0.It means, if a particle in position x = 0at timet = 0is in its mean position and moving upwards (represented by first wave) then the same particle will be in its mean position but moving downwards (represented by the second wave). Similarly, the waves y A kx t = sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 and y A kx t = \u2013 sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 are also out of phase.

Now, corresponding to this equation we can have two graphs and two simple equations. First Graph In y x t ( , )equation, if value of t is fixed (or substituted), then the equation left is y x ( )equation.So, we can plot y x - graph corresponding to this equation. And obviously the graph (or the equation) will be a sine or cosine graph. For example Suppose a sine wave is travelling along positive x -direction on a string. At a given time (say at 9 AM), the y x - graph may be as shown in the figure. The important points in the above graph are (i) amplitude of oscillation is 10 mm. (ii) at 9 AM, y-displacement of the string particle at x = 2 m is \u22125mm and of the particle at x = 6 m is + 4mm. Or, we can say that this graph represents SHM y-displacements of different string particles (at different x -coordinates) at 9 AM. Hence, this is a photograph (or snapshot) of the string at 9 AM. (iii) Slope of this graph at any point is \u2202 \u2202 y x not dy dx \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7, as y has two variables x and t. (iv) Two string particles at different locations are in different phases. The phase difference between them is given by \u2206 \u2206 \u03c6 \u03c0 \u03bb = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 ( ) x Here, \u2206x is the path difference between them. For example Particles \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018b\u2019 have a path difference of \u03bb 2 . So, phase difference between them is \u03c0. Particle \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018c\u2019 have a path difference of \u03bb. So, phase difference is 2\u03c0. Similarly, particles \u2018c\u2019 and \u2018d\u2019 have a path difference of \u03bb 4. Therefore, the phase difference is \u03c0 2. (v) From the above graph, we cannot determine the direction of wave velocity. For that, wave equation will be required. Chapter 17 Wave Motion \u0097 11 e d c b 2 a +4 +10 \u201310 \u20135 x(m) 6 y(mm) Fig. 17.5  Second Graph In y x t ( , ) equation, if the value of x is fixed (or substituted) then the equation left is y t( ) equation. So, we can plot y t- graph corresponding to this equation. Again, the graph (or the equation) will be a sine or cosine graph. For example Suppose a sine wave is travelling along positive x -direction on a string. At a given position (say x = 4 m), the y t- graph may be as shown in the figure. The important points in this graph are (i) amplitude of oscillations is 6 mm. (ii) y-displacement of the particle at x = 4m is 4 mm at 4 s. Similarly, y-displacement of the particle at x = 4m is \u22125 mm at 8 s or we can say that this graph is basically SHM y t- graph of the string particle at x = 4m, which shows different SHM y-displacements of this particle at different times or it is videography of SHM oscillations of this particle. (iii) Slope of this particle at any time is \u2202 \u2202 y t and this is SHM velocity ( ) = \u00b1 \u2212 \u03c9 A y 2 2 of the particle at x = 4m at that time. (iv) The same particle at two different times will have different phase angles. The phase difference in a time interval of \u2206t is given by \u2206 \u2206 \u03c6 \u03c0 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 T t For example, t1 and t2 have a time interval of T 2 \u22c5So, phase difference is \u03c0. t2 and t3 have a time interval of T 4 \u22c5So, the phase difference is \u03c0 2. Similarly, t1 and t4 have a time interval of T. Therefore, phase difference is 2\u03c0. 12 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics \u20135 \u20136 +6 +4 t (s) 4 8 t1 t2 t3 t4 y (mm) Fig. 17.6  Wave velocity (v), particle velocity (v p) and particle acceleration ( ) a p in a Sinusoidal wave Wave velocity (v) is the velocity by which oscillations of y (or energy) transfer from one point to another point. Later, we will see that this velocity depends on characteristics of medium. Particle velocity ( ) vP and particle acceleration (aP) are different. In a sinusoidal wave, particles of the medium oscillate simple harmonically about their mean position. Therefore, all the formulae we have read in SHM apply to the particles here also. For example, maximum particle velocity is \u00b1 A\u03c9 at mean position and it is zero at extreme positions etc. Similarly, maximum particle acceleration is \u00b1 \u03c92 A at extreme positions and zero at mean position. However, the wave velocity is different from the particle velocity. This depends on certain characteristics of the medium. Unlike the particle velocity which oscillates simple harmonically (between + A\u03c9 and \u2013 A\u03c9) the wave velocity is constant for given characteristics of the medium. Suppose, a sine wave travelling along positive x- axis is y x t A kx t ( , ) sin ( \u2013 ) = \u03c9 \u2026(i) Let us differentiate this function partially with respect to t and x. \u2202 \u2202 = y x t t A kx t ( , ) \u2013 cos ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 \u03c9 \u2026(ii) \u2202 \u2202 = y x t x Ak kx t ( , ) cos ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 \u2026(iii) Now, these can be written as \u2202 \u2202 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u2202 \u2202 y x t t k y x t x ( , ) \u2013 ( , ) \u03c9 Here, \u2202 \u2202 = y x t t ( , ) particle velocity vP \u03c9 k = wave velocity v and \u2202 \u2202 = y x t x ( , ) slope of the wave Thus, v v P = \u2013 ( ) slope \u2026(iv) i.e. particle velocity at a given position and time is equal to negative of the product of wave velocity with slope of the wave at that point at that instant. Acceleration of the particle is the second partial derivative of y x t ( , ) with respect to t, \u2234 a y x t t A kx t y x t P = \u2202 \u2202 = = 2 2 2 2 ( , ) \u2013 sin ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ( , ) \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 i.e. acceleration of the particle equals \u2013 \u03c92 times its displacement, which is the same result we obtained in SHM. Thus, aP = \u2013 ( ) \u03c92 displacement \u2026(v) Chapter 17 Wave Motion \u0097 13  We can also show that, \u2202 \u2202 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7\u22c5\u2202 \u2202 2 2 2 2 2 2 y x t t k y x t x ( , ) ( , ) \u03c9 or \u2202 \u2202 = \u2202 \u2202 2 2 2 2 2 y x t t v y x t x ( , ) ( , ) \u2026(vi) which is also the wave equation. Fig. 17.7 shows velocity ( ) vP and acceleration ( ) aP given by Eqs. (iv) and (v) for two points 1 and 2 on a string. The sinusoidal wave is travelling along positive x-direction. At 1 Slope of the curve is positive. Hence, from Eq. (iv) particle velocity ( ) vP is negative or downwards. Similarly, displacement of the particle is positive, so from Eq. (v) acceleration will also be negative or downwards. At 2 Slope is negative while displacement is positive. Hence, vP will be positive (upwards) and aP is negative (downwards). Note Direction of vP will change if the wave travels along negative x-direction. V Example 17.5 Under what condition, maximum particle velocity is four times the wave velocity corresponding to the equation, y A t kx = \u2212 sin( ) \u03c9 Solution Maximum particle velocity is \u03c9A and wave velocity is \u03c9 k . Now, given that maximum particle velocity = 4 (wave velocity) or \u03c9 \u03c9 A k = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 4 \u2234 A k = 4 So, this is the required condition. 14 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics y x vP aP v ,a P P v 1 2 Fig. 17.7  V Example 17.6 A transverse sinusoidal wave moves along a string in the positive x-direction at a speed of 10 cm/s.

Waves of all frequencies or all wavelengths travel in a given medium with same speed. For examples, all electromagnetic waves travel in vacuum with same speed ( ) \u2248 \u00d7 3 108 m/s . In water, this speed will be different. Similarly, all longitudinal waves (including the sound wave) travel in air with the same speed ( ) \u2248330 m/s . Now, frequency of a wave depends on source and wavelength is self adjusted in a value, \u03bb = v f In the above expression, v is same (obviously in a given medium) for all sources (or frequencies). So, with increase in value of f , wavelength \u03bb automatically decreases. For example, usually frequency of female voice is more than frequency of male voice. So, wavelength of female voice will be less. V Example 17.9 Speed of sound in air is 330 m s/ . Find maximum and minimum wavelength of audible sound in air.

(ii) Longitudinal wave speed in all three states: solid, liquid and gas. Chapter 17 Wave Motion \u0097 17 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 17.4  Transverse Wave Speed on a String Speed of transverse wave on a string is given by v T = \u00b5 Here, \u00b5 = mass per unit length of the string = m l = mA lA (A = area of cross-section of the string) = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 m V A (V = volume of string) = \u03c1A (\u03c1 = density of string) Hence, the above expression can also be written as v T A = \u03c1 Proof Consider a pulse travelling along a string with a speed v to the right. If the amplitude of the pulse is small compared to the length of the string, the tension T will be approximately constant along the string. In the reference frame moving with speed v to the right, the pulse is stationary and the string moves with a speed v to the left. Figure shows a small segment of the string of length \u2206l. This segment forms a part of a circular arc of radius R. Instantaneously, the segment is moving with speed v in a circular path, so it has a centripetal acceleration v R 2 . The forces acting on the segment are the tension T at each end. The horizontal components of these forces are equal and opposite and thus cancel. The vertical components of these forces point radially inward toward the centre of the circular arc. These radial forces provide the centripetal acceleration. Let the angle subtended by the segment at centre be 2\u03b8.The net radial force acting on the segment is \u03a3F T T r = = 2 2 sin \u03b8 \u03b8 18 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 R \u03a3Fr T T O v \u2206l (b) v \u2206l ar = v R 2 R O (a) Fig. 17.9 (a) To obtain the speed v of a wave on a stretched string, it is convenient to describe the motion of a small segment of the string in a moving frame of reference. (b) In the moving frame of reference, the small segment of length \u2206l moves to the left with speed v. The net force on the segment is in the radial direction because the horizontal components of the tension forces are cancelled.  Where we have used the approximation sin \u03b8 \u03b8 \u2248 for small \u03b8. If \u00b5 is the mass per unit length of the string, the mass of the segment of length \u2206l is m l R = = \u00b5 \u00b5 \u03b8 \u2206 2 (as \u2206l R = 2 \u03b8) From Newton\u2019s second law, \u03a3F ma mv R r = = 2 or 2 2 2 T R v R \u03b8 \u00b5 \u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 ( ) \u2234 v T = \u00b5 Longitudinal Wave Speed in Three States Speed of longitudinal wave through a gas (or a liquid) is given by v B = \u03c1 Here, B = Bulk modulus of the gas (or liquid) and \u03c1 = density of the gas (or liquid) Now Newton, who first deduced this relation for v, assumed that during the passage of a sound wave through a gas (or air), the temperature of the gas remains constant, i.e. sound wave travels under isothermal conditions and hence took B to be the isothermal elasticity of the gas and which is equal to its pressure p. So, Newton\u2019s formula for the velocity of a sound wave (or a longitudinal wave) in a gaseous medium becomes v p = \u03c1 If, however, we calculate the velocity of sound in air at NTP with the help of this formula by substituting. p = \u00d7 1.01 N/m 105 2 and \u03c1 = \u00d7 \u2212 1.29 kg/m 3 10 3 then v comes out to be nearly 280 m/s. Actually, the velocity of sound in air at NTP as measured by Newton himself, is found to be 332 m/s. Newton could not explain this large discrepancy between his theoretical and experimental results. Laplace after 140 years correctly argued that a sound wave passes through a gas (or air) very rapidly. So, adiabatic conditions are developed. So, he took B to be the adiabatic elasticity of the gas, which is equal to \u03b3 p where \u03b3 is the ratio of Cp (molar heat capacity at constant pressure) and CV (molar heat capacity at constant volume). Thus, Newton\u2019s formula as corrected by Laplace becomes v p = \u03b3 \u03c1 For air, \u03b3 =1.41, so that in air, v p = 1.41 \u03c1 which gives 331.6 m/s as the velocity of sound (in air) at NTP which is in agreement with Newton\u2019s experimental result. Chapter 17 Wave Motion \u0097 19  Speed of longitudinal wave in a thin rod or wire is given by v Y = \u03c1 Here, Y is the Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity.

In a sinusoidal wave, these oscillations are simple harmonic in nature. Each particle has some energy of oscillation. At the same time, energy transfer also takes place. Related to energy of oscillation and energy transfer, there are three terms, namely, energy density (u), power ( ) P and intensity ( ) I . Energy density ( ) u Energy of oscillation per unit volume is called energy density ( ) u . Its SI unit is J/m 3. In case of SHM, energy of oscillation (of a single particle) is E m A = 1 2 2 2 \u03c9 . In a sinusoidal wave, each particle of the string oscillates simple harmonically. Therefore, Energy density energy of oscillation volume = or u E V m A V = = 1 2 2 2 \u03c9 But, m V = density or \u03c1 \u2234 u A = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 Power (P) Energy transferred per unit time is called power. The expression of power is P A Sv = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 Here, S is area of cross-section of the medium in which wave is travelling and v is the wave speed. SI unit of power is J/s or Watt. Now, let us derive the above expression for a sinusoidal travelling wave on a string. Area of cross-section of string is S and the wave speed is v . Suppose at time t =0, wave is at point M. In 1 s, it will travel a distance v and it will reach at point N.Or, we can say that v new length of string will start oscillating. Area of cross-section of string is S. Therefore, in 1 s, Sv new volume of string will start oscillating. Energy of oscillation per unit volume is called energy density (u). So, in 1 s, (uSv) new energy will be added or (uSv) energy will be transferred from the source. Energy transferred in one second is called power. \u2234 P uSv = = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 A Sv (as u A = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 ) or P A Sv = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 This is the desired expression of power. 22 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics v M N t = 0 t = 1 s Fig. 17.14  Extra Points to Remember Intensity ( )I Energy transferred per unit cross-sectional area per unit time is called intensity. Thus, I = Energy transferred time cross - sectional area ( )( ) = Power cross - sectional area = P S = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 A Sv S or I A v = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 The SI unit of intensity is J/s-m 2 or Watt/m 2. \u0098 Although the above relations for power and intensity have been discussed for a transverse wave on a string, they hold good for other waves also. \u0098 In SHM, potential energy is maximum (and kinetic energy is zero) at the extreme positions. \u0098 For a string segment, the potential energy depends on the slope of the string and is maximum when the slope is maximum, which is at the equilibrium position of the segment, the same position for which the kinetic energy is maximum. At A : Kinetic energy and potential energy both are zero. At B : Kinetic energy and potential energy both are maximum. \u0098 Intensity due to a point source If a point source emits wave uniformly in all directions, the energy at a distance r from the source is distributed uniformly on a spherical surface of radius r and areaS r = 4 2 \u03c0 .If P is the power emitted by the source, the power per unit area at a distance r from the source is P r 4 2 \u03c0 . The average power per unit area that is incident perpendicular to the direction of propagation is called the intensity. Therefore, I P r = 4 2 \u03c0 or I r \u221d1 2 V Example 17.12 A stretched string is forced to transmit transverse waves by means of an oscillator coupled to one end. The string has a diameter of 4 mm. The amplitude of the oscillation is 10 4 \u2212 m and the frequency is 10 Hz. Tension in the string is 100 N and mass density of wire is 4.2 \u00d7 103 3 kg m / .

        "content": "Type 1. Based on symmetry of a wave pulse Concept To check symmetry of a wave pulse or wave velocity, always concentrate on maximum or minimum value of y. For example, Wave pulse shown in Fig. (i) is symmetric but the wave pulse shown in Fig. (ii) is asymmetric. Now, the question is how will you check whether the pulse is symmetric or not. The answer is In both cases maximum value of y at the given time (say t0) is at x x = 0. Now, if y t t ( = 0, x x x y = + = 0 \u2206) (t t = 0, x x x = \u2212 0 \u2206),then the pulse is symmetric otherwise not. So, at a given time (or any other time of your choice) first of all you have to find that x coordinate where you are getting the maximum value of y. Further, suppose that maximum value of y is at x1 at time t1 and at x2 at time t t 2 1 ( ) > .

The shape of pulse at x = 0 and t = 0 would be as shown in figure y ( , ) 0 0 5 = = 0.8 0.16 m From the equation it is clear that ymax 0.16 m = Pulse will be symmetric (symmetry is checked about ymax) if At t = 0 ; y x y x ( ) (\u2013 ) = From the given equation y x x y x x t ( ) (\u2013 ) = + = + \uf8fc \uf8fd \uf8f4\uf8f4 \uf8fe \uf8f4 \uf8f4 = 0.8 0.8 at 16 5 16 5 0 2 2 and or y x y x ( ) (\u2013 ) = Therefore, pulse is symmetric. Speed of pulse At t = 1 s and x = \u2013 1.25 m, value of y is again 0.16 m, i.e. pulse has travelled a distance of 1.25 m in 1 second in negative x-direction or we can say that the speed of pulse is 1.25 m/s and it is travelling in negative x-direction.

In this type of problem, y x ( ) equation will be given at two different times and we have to find the wave velocity. How to Solve? l At the given time find the x- coordinates where you are getting the maximum (or minimum) value of y. From these two x- coordinates and two times we can calculate the wave velocity by the method discussed in Type 1. V Example 2 At time t=0, y x ( ) equation of a wave pulse is y x = + \u2212 10 2 2 2 ( ) and at t s = 2 , y x ( ) equation of the same wave pulse is y x = + + 10 2 4 2 ( ) Here, y is in mm and x in metres.

So, peak of the wave pulse has travelled a distance of 6 m (from x =2 m to x = \u22124 m) in 2 s along negative x -direction. Hence, the wave velocity is v= \u2212 = \u2212 6 2 3 m /s Ans. Type 3.

Further, y x ( ) equation of the wave pulse at t = 0 is y x = + + 10 2 2 4 2 ( ) (a) From the given information make complete y x t ( , ) equation. (b) Find y x ( ) equation at t = 1 s Solution (a) Here, coefficient to x is 2. Wave speed is 2 m/s. Therefore, coefficient of t v = (coefficient of x ) = \u00d7 2 2 = 4 units. Further, coefficient of x is positive and the wave is travelling along positive x -direction. Hence, coefficient of t must be negative. Now, suppose the y x t ( , ) function is y x t = + \u2212 + 10 2 2 4 2 ( ) \u03b1 \u2026(i) Here, \u03b1 is a constant. At time t = 0, Eq. (i) becomes y x = + + 10 2 2 2 ( ) \u03b1 and the given function is y x = + + 10 2 2 4 2 ( ) Therefore, the value of \u03b1 is 4. Substituting in Eq.

Based on transverse wave speed on a string Concept (i) We know that transverse wave speed is given by v T = \u00b5 or T S \u03c1 (ii) If tension is uniform, then v is also uniform and we can calculate the time taken by the wave pulse in travelling from one point to another point by the direct relation t = distance speed If tension is non-uniform, then v will be non-uniform and in that case time can be obtained by integration. 30 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  V Example 4 A uniform rope of mass 0.1 kg and length 2.45 m hangs from a ceiling. (a) Find the speed of transverse wave in the rope at a point 0.5 m distant from the lower end. (b) Calculate the time taken by a transverse wave to travel the full length of the rope. Solution (a) As the string has mass and it is suspended vertically, tension in it will be different at different points. For a point at a distance x from the free end, tension will be due to the weight of the string below it. So, if m is the mass of string of length l, the mass of length x of the string will be m l x \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 . \u2234 T m l xg xg = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \u00b5 m l = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u00b5 \u2234 T xg \u00b5 = or v T xg = = \u00b5 \u2026(i) At x = 0.5 m, v = \u00d7 0.5 9.8 = 2.21 m/s (b) From Eq. (i), we can see that velocity of the wave is different at different points. So, if at point x the wave travels a distance dx in time dt, then dt dx v dx gx = = \u2234 dt dx gx t l 0 0 \u222b \u222b = or t l g = 2 = 2 2.45 9.8 = 1.0 s Ans. Type 5. To write the equation corresponding to given y x - graph (or a snapshot) at a given time Concept From the given y x - graph, we can easily determine A, \u03c9 and k. Secondly, we have to check whether the wave is travelling along positive x -direction or negative x -direction. Because this factor will decide whether, \u03c9t and kx should be of same sign or opposite sign.

Find its wavelength while reaching at point A. Concept While moving from B to A, tension will increase. So, wave speed will also increase (as v T = / \u00b5). Frequency will remain unchanged because it depends on source. Therefore, wavelength will also increase (as \u03bb = v f or \u03bb \u221dv).

Then, according to principle of superposition net displacement at P (from its mean position) at any time is given by y y y = + 1 2 Here, y1 and y2 are the displacements of P due to two waves individually. For example, suppose at 9AM, displacement of P above its mean position should be 6mm accordingly to wave-1 and the same time its displacement should be 2mm below its mean position accordingly to wave-2, then at 9AM net displacement of P will be 4mm above its mean position. Now, based upon the principle of superposition we have two phenomena in physics, interference and beats. Stationary waves (or standing waves) and Young's double slit experiment (or YDSE) are two examples of interference. Based on principle of superposition means two or more than two waves meet at one point or several points and at every point net displacement is y y y = + 1 2 or y y y y = + + 1 2 3 etc. 18.2 Resultant Amplitude and Intensity due to Coherent Sources In article 18.1, we have seen that the two waves from two sources S1 and S 2 were meeting at point P. Suppose they meet at P in a phase difference \u2206\u03c6 (or\u03c6). If this phase difference remains constant with time, then sources are called coherent, otherwise incoherent. For sources to be coherent the frequencies ( f , \u03c9 or T ) of the two sources must be same. This can be explained by the following example. Suppose the phase difference is 0\u00b0. It means they are in same phase. Both reach their extremes (+ A or \u2212A), simultaneously. They cross their mean positions (in the same direction) simultaneously. Now, if we want their phase difference to remain constant or we want that the above situation is maintained all the time, then obviously their time periods (or frequencies) must be same. Resultant Amplitude 1. Consider the superposition of two sinusoidal waves of same frequency (means sources are coherent) at a point. Let us assume that the two waves are travelling in the same direction with same velocity. The equation of the two waves reaching at a point can be written as y A kx t 1 1 = sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 and y A kx t 2 2 = + \u03c6 sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 52 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics ",

Phase difference between first wave and second wave is 60\u00b0. Path difference between first wave and third wave is \u03bb 3. The first wave lags behind in phase angle from second and third wave. Find resultant intensity at this point. Solution Here, the sources are three. So, we don't have any direct formula for finding the resultant intensity. First we will find the resultant amplitude by vector method and then by the relation I A \u221d 2, we can also find the resulting intensity. Further, a path difference of \u03bb 3 is equivalent to a phase difference of 120\u00b0 (\u2206\u03c6 or \u03c6 \u03c0 \u03bb = \u22c5 2 \u2206x). Hence, the phase difference first and second is 60\u00b0 and between first and third is 120\u00b0.

Find resultant intensity at this point. 18.4 Standing Wave Standing wave is an example of interference. When two identical waves travel in opposite directions, then they superimpose almost at every point. Now, since the waves are identical (or their frequencies are same), sources are coherent. So, interference will take place. By their superposition (or interference) standing waves (also called stationary waves) are formed. By identical wave we mean that all properties (like f ,\u03c9,T, \u03bb and k) are same. Only amplitudes may be different but still we prefer equal amplitudes ( ) A A A 1 2 0 = = . The following are listed some of the important points in standing wave. (i) Here, the constructive interference points are called antinodes (denoted by A) and destructive interference points are called nodes (denoted by N). (ii) Distance between two successive nodes (or two successive antinodes) is \u03bb 2 or \u03c0 k as k = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2\u03c0 \u03bb . Similarly, distance between a node and its adjacent antinode is \u03bb 4 or \u03c0 2k. Here, \u03bb and k are the values corresponding to constituent waves by which stationary waves are formed. (iii) Amplitude of oscillation in stationary wave varies from a maximum value (A A 1 2 + or 2 0 A at antinode) to a minimum value (A A 1 2 ~ or zero at node). But now onwards (unless mentioned in the question) we will talk about the equal amplitudes. So, amplitude at antinode will be 2 0 A and at node it is zero. Thus, now we can say that, in stationary wave all particles (except nodes for the case when A A 1 2 = ) oscillate with same frequency but different amplitudes. 58 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 18.1  (iv) All points lying between two successive nodes are in same phase. They cross their mean positions (in the same direction) simultaneously and reach their extreme positions also simultaneously. But they are out of phase with the particles lying between adjacent two nodes. This can be shown by the following figure. In the above figure N1, N 2 and N 3 are nodes and A A 1 2 , are antinodes. Amplitude at nodes is zero and amplitude at antinodes is 2 0 A . In between them we have taken four more points P1, P2, P3 and P4. Suppose amplitude at these points is A0 (between 2 0 A and 0). Now, at t = 0 all particles are at their mean positions. Particles P1, A1 and P2 are moving upwards (as they are in same phase) and the particles P3, A2 and P4 are moving downwards. At this time, they have maximum speed. For example, in case of sine wave, v A ",

If two waves differ only in amplitude and are propagated in opposite directions through a medium, will they produce standing waves. Is energy transported? 4.

Determine the wavelength, frequency and speed of the interfering waves. 18.5 Normal Modes of a String In an unbounded continuous medium, there is no restriction on the frequencies or wavelengths of the standing waves. However, if the waves are confined in space, for example, when a string is tied at both ends,standing waves can be set-up for a discrete set of frequencies or wavelengths. Consider a string of definite length l, rigidly held at both ends. When we setup a sinusoidal wave on such a string, it gets reflected from the fixed ends. By the superposition of two identical waves travelling in opposite directions standing waves are established on the string. The only requirement we have to satisfy is that the end points be nodes as these points cannot oscillate. They are permanently at rest. There may be any number of nodes in between or none at all, so that the wavelength associated with the standing waves can take many different values. The distance between adjacent nodes is \u03bb/ ,2 so that in a string of length l there must be exactly an integral number n of half wavelengths \u03bb/2. That is, n l \u03bb 2 = or \u03bb = 2l n (n = \u2026 1 2 3 , , ) Chapter 18 Superposition of Waves \u0097 63 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 18.2  But \u03bb = v f and v T = \u00b5 , so that the natural frequencies of oscillation of the system are f n v l n l T = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= 2 2 \u00b5 (n = \u2026 1 2 3 , , ) The smallest frequency f1 corresponds to the largest wavelength ( ), n =1 \u03bb1 2 = l. f v l 1 2 = This is called the fundamental frequency. The other standing wave frequencies are f v l f 2 1 2 2 2 = = f v l f 3 1 3 2 3 = = and so on These frequencies are called harmonics. Musicians sometimes call them overtones. Students are advised to remember these frequencies by name. For example, f1 = fundamental tone or first harmonic f f 2 1 2 = = first overtone or second harmonic f f 3 1 3 = = second overtone or third harmonic and so on. 64 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics \u03bb/2 = l 2 /2 = \u03bb l 3 /2 = \u03bb l 4 /2 \u03bb = l (a) = 1 n (b) = 2 n (c) = 3 n (d) = 4 n First harmonic or Fundamental tone N Second harmonic or First overtone N Third harmonic or Second overtone N Fourth harmonic or Third overtone N N N N N A A A A A A A A A A Fig. 18.7  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 We have seen that the natural frequencies of oscillation of a stretched wire are given by f n l T = 2 \u00b5 Now, tension in the wire can be produced by the following two methods. Method 1 By suspending a weight W from the wire AB as shown. In this case, transverse stationary waves are produced in wire AB. Method 2 Wire ABis stretched at some higher temperature (than the normal room temperature). When temperature decreases, thermal stresses are produced and the wire comes under tension. Detailed discussion of thermal expansion will be covered in chapter 20. \u0098 If by somehow, tension is decreased (for example: when weight is partially or fully immersed in a liquid), then from the above expression we can see that the set of frequencies decrease. \u0098 As n increases, T, \u00b5, l and therefore v T = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u00b5 remain unchanged. Frequency increases, therefore wavelength \u03bb = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 v f and the loop size ( / ) = \u03bb 2 decrease. \u0098 Even and odd both harmonics (n=1, 2, 3, \u2026) are obtained with stretched wire fixed at both ends. V Example 18.7 In terms of T, \u00b5 and l , find frequency of (a) fourth overtone mode (b) third harmonic Solution (a) Fourth overtone mode means n = 5 (n =1, 2, 3, 4, 5) Therefore, using the equation f n l T l T = = 2 5 2 \u00b5 \u00b5 Ans. (b) Third harmonic means n = 3 \u2234 f l T = 3 2 \u00b5 Ans.

Chapter 18 Superposition of Waves \u0097 67 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 18.3 Fig. 18.11  18.6 Reflection and Transmission of a Wave Following points are important in reflection and transmission of a wave : (i) Speed From wave point of view that medium is called a denser medium in which speed of wave is less. For example, for a sound wave (or longitudinal wave) air is denser medium compared to water because speed of sound in air is less. On the other hand, air is rarer medium for an electromagnetic wave as speed of electromagnetic wave in air is more. When a wave strikes the boundary separating two different media, part of it is reflected and part is transmitted. Since, wave speed depends upon the medium, in reflection wave speed does not change because medium does not change. In transmission, medium changes, therefore wave speed also changes. In denser medium it decreases. (ii) Frequency Frequency (\u03c9 and T also) depends on source. In reflection as well as transmission source does not change. Therefore, frequency does not change. (iii) Wavelength Wavelength (and therefore wave number k = 2\u03c0 \u03bb also) is self adjusted in a value, \u03bb = v f . In reflection v and f do not change, therefore \u03bb and k do not change. In transmission, f remains unchanged but v changes. Therefore, \u03bb and k both change. In a denser medium, v decreases, therefore \u03bb also decreases but k increases. (iv) Phase change A phase change of \u03c0 or 180\u00b0 occurs only during the reflection from a denser medium. In any other case (in transmission or reflection from a rarer medium) phase change is zero. (v) Amplitude In reflection as well as transmission, amplitude changes. If amplitude of incident wave in medium-1 is Ai , it is partly reflected and partly transmitted at the boundary of two media-1 and 2. Wave speeds in two media are v1 and v2. If amplitudes of reflected and transmitted waves are Ar and At , then A v v v v A r i = \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 1 2 1 and A v v v A t i = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 2 1 2 From the above two expressions, we can make the following conclusions : Conclusion 1 If v v 1 2 = , then Ar = 0 and A A t i = Basically v v 1 2 = means both media are same from wave point of view. So, in this case there is no reflection ( ) Ar = 0 , only transmission ( ) A A t i = is there. Conclusion 2 If v v 2 1 < , then Ar comes out to be negative. Now, v v 2 1 < means the second medium is denser. Ar in this case is negative means, there is a phase change of \u03c0. 68 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics Reflected wave Transmitted wave Incident wave 1 2 Fig. 18.12  Conclusion 3 If v v 2 1 > , then A A t i > . This implies that amplitude always increases as the wave travels from a denser medium to rarer medium (as v v 2 1 > , so second medium is rarer). (vi) Power At the boundary of two media, energy incident per second = energy reflected per second + energy transmitted per second. or Power incident = power reflected + power transmitted or P P P i r t = + Let us summarise the above discussion in tabular form as below. Table 18.2 Wave property Reflection Transmission (Refraction) v does not change changes f T , , \u03c9 do not change do not change \u03bb, k do not change change A I, change change \u03c6 \u2206\u03c6 = 0, from a rarer medium \u2206\u03c6 = 0 \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c0,from a denser medium V Example 18.10 Two strings 1 and 2 are taut between two fixed supports (as shown in figure) such that the tension in both strings is same. Mass per unit length of 2 is more than that of 1. Explain which string is denser for a transverse travelling wave. Solution Speed of a transverse wave on a string, v T = \u00b5 or v \u221d1 \u00b5 Now, \u00b5 \u00b5 2 1 > (given) \u2234 v v 2 1 < i.e. medium 2 is denser and medium 1 is rarer. V Example 18.11 A sound wave and a light wave are reflected and refracted (or transmitted) from water surface. Show the changes in different physical quantities associated with a wave. Solution Sound wave We have seen in article 18.6, that water is a rarer medium for sound. When a wave travels from a denser to rarer medium, it bends away from normal. Its speed, wavelength and amplitude increase but angular wave number decreases. Further, in reflection from a rarer medium and in transmission there is no change in phase angle.

At a junction with string 2 it is partly reflected and partly transmitted. The linear mass density of the second string is four times that of the first string, and that the boundary between the two strings is at x = 0.

(b) Show that the average power carried by the incident wave is equal to the sum of the average power carried by the transmitted and reflected waves. Solution (a) Since, v T = /\u00b5, T T 2 1 = and \u00b5 \u00b5 2 1 4 = We have, v v 2 1 2 = \u2026(i) From Table 18.2, we can see that the frequency does not change, that is \u03c9 \u03c9 1 2 = \u2026(ii) 70 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics Air Water Rarer Denser 1 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 2 3 Fig. 18.15 Air Water Denser Rarer 1 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b3 2 3 Fig. 18.14  Also, because k v = \u03c9 , the wave numbers of the harmonic waves in the two strings are related by k v v v k 2 2 2 1 1 1 1 1 2 2 2 = = = = \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 / \u2026(iii) The amplitudes are A v v v A v v v A t i i = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa= 2 2 2 2 2 3 2 1 2 1 1 1 ( / ) ( / ) \u2026(iv) and A v v v v A v v v v A r i i = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa = 2 1 1 2 1 1 1 1 2 2 \u2013 ( / ) \u2013 ( / ) \u2013 Ai 3 \u2026(v) Now with Eqs.

The equation of standing wave basically depends on the component waves. Further, if the maximum amplitude is2A, it means amplitude of travelling waves is A and if it is A, then amplitude of travelling waves is A 2. 2. Resonance If the string (discussed in Art 18.5) is set vibrating in anyone of the normal modes and left to itself, the oscillations gradually die out. The motion is damped by dissipation of energy through the elastic supports at the ends and by the resistance of the air to the motion. We can pump energy into the system by applying a driving force. If the driving frequency is equal to any natural frequency of the string, the string will vibrate at that frequency with a larger amplitude. This phenomenon is called resonance. Because the string has a large number of natural frequencies, resonance can occur at many different frequencies. 3. Reason of phase change of \u03c0 in reflection from a denser medium When a transverse wave is reflected at the rigid support, a phase change of \u03c0 takes place in the displacement. Suppose a transverse pulse is produced along a string PQ whose end Q is attached to a rigid support. If the pulse travels in the form of a crest, then on reaching the rigid support, the pulse would exert an upward force. Since the support is rigid, it remains unaffected but a reaction force act in the downward direction on the string which reverses the sign of the displacement of the particle atQ. As a result, an inverted pulse in the form of a trough travels back as shown. This concept can also be understood by a second thought process. Incident wave and reflected wave are two identical waves travelling in opposite directions. So, they should produce a stationary wave. Point Q is a fixed point, which cannot oscillate at all. So, Q should become a node. This is possible only when the two displacements (one due to incident wave y1 and the other due to reflected wave y 2) are always equal and opposite (y y y = + = 1 2 0 or y y 1 2 = \u2212 ). Or, they have a phase difference of \u03c0. Chapter 18 Superposition of Waves \u0097 73 Crest Trough Incident wave P P Q Q Fig. 18.17  ",

To find length of oscillating wire from the equation of stationary wave How to Solve? l From the given equation of stationary wave find the value of wave number k and then \u03bb.

To find amplitude at some given point in stationary wave Concept In a stationary wave amplitude at different points varies from 0 at node (when A A A 1 2 0 = = ) to maximum ( ) = 2 0 A at antinode. If by some how, Amax, k and position of node or position of antinode is known then we can find amplitude at any general point. For example, if position of node is known, then take this point as x = 0. Now, amplitude at any general point x is A A kx x = max sin In this expression we can see that Ax = 0 at x = 0. Similarly, if position of antinode is known then amplitude at general point x is A A kx x = max cos Again we can see that, A A x = max at x = 0. V Example 2 Length of a stretched wire is 2m. It is oscillating in its fourth overtone mode. Maximum amplitude of oscillations is 2mm. Find amplitude of oscillation at a distance of 0.2 m from one fixed end.

To find energy of oscillation in a given portion in stationary wave Concept In SHM, energy of oscillation of a single particle is given by E m A = 1 2 2 2 \u03c9 In a travelling sine wave, all particles oscillate with same amplitude and same frequency. Energy density (or energy per unit volume) is given by u A = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1\u03c9 Since \u03c1 \u03c9 , and A is same at all points. Therefore, energy density will be same at all points. So, in each unit volume equal amount of energy will be stored. Therefore, to find total energy of oscillation in a given volume, we just multiply the given volume by this constant energy density. In stationary wave, amplitude is different at different positions. So, energy density will be non-uniform. Hence, total energy of oscillation in a given volume can be obtained by integration. There is an alternate method also. By adding two energy densities of the travelling waves (from which standing wave is formed) first of all we find the total energy density. Then, we multiply the given volume with this energy density. V Example 3 A standing wave is formed by two harmonic waves, y A kx t 1 = sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 and y A kx t 2 = + sin ( ) \u03c9 travelling on a string in opposite directions. Mass density of the string is \u03c1 and area of cross-section is s. Find the total mechanical energy between two adjacent nodes on the string. Solution The distance between two adjacent nodes is \u03bb 2 or \u03c0 k. \u2234Volume of string between two nodes will be V = (area of cross-section) \u00d7 (distance between two nodes) = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ( ) S k \u03c0 Energy density (energy per unit volume) of a travelling wave is given by u A = 1 2 2 2 \u03c1 \u03c9 A standing wave is formed by two identical waves travelling in opposite directions.

Let us take an element of length dx at a distance x from N1. Mass of this element is dm Sdx ( ) = \u03c1 . This can be treated as point mass. This element oscillates simple harmonically with angular frequency \u03c9 and amplitude 2A kx sin . Hence, energy of this element dE dm A kx = 1 2 2 2 2 ( ) ( sin ) ( ) \u03c9 dE Sdx A kx = 1 2 2 2 2 ( ) ( sin ) \u03c1 \u03c9 Integrating this with the limits from x = 0 to x k = \u03c0, we get the same result. Type 4. Based on the formation of the reflected pulse, either from a rigid boundary or from a free boundary Concept The formation of the reflected pulse can be obtained by overlapping two pulses travelling in opposite directions. The net displacement at any point is given by the principle of superposition.

Assertion : When a wave travels from a denser medium to rarer medium, then amplitude of oscillation increases. Reason : In denser medium, speed of wave is less compared to a rarer medium. 4. Assertion : A wire is stretched and then fixed at two ends. It oscillates in its second overtone mode. There are total four nodes and three antinodes. Reason : In second overtone mode, length of wire should be l = 3 2 \u03bb , where \u03bb is wavelength. 5. Assertion : If we see the oscillations of a stretched wire at higher overtone mode, frequency of oscillation increases but wavelength decreases. Reason : From v f = \u03bb, \u03bb \u221d1 f as v = constant. 6. Assertion : Standing waves are formed when amplitudes of two constituent waves are equal. Reason : At any point net displacement at a given time is resultant of displacement of constituent waves. 7. Assertion : In a standing wave x = 0 is a node. Then, total mechanical energy lying between x = 0 and x = \u03bb 8 is not equal to the energy lying between x = \u03bb 8 and x = \u03bb 4 . Reason : In standing waves different particles oscillate with different amplitudes. 8. Assertion : Ratio of maximum intensity and minimum intensity in interference is 25 1 : .

Assertion : Three waves of equal amplitudes interfere at a point. Phase difference between two successive waves is \u03c0 2 . Then, resultant intensity is same as the intensity due to individual wave. Reason : For interference to take place sources must be coherent. 10.

The reason is that the human ear is tremendously sensitive and can detect sound waves even of very low intensity. The human ear is sensitive to waves in the frequency range from about 20 to 20000 Hz called the audible range, but we also use the term sound for similar waves with frequencies above (ultrasonic) and below (infrasonic) the range of human hearing. Our main concern in this chapter is with sound waves in air, but sound can travel through any gas, liquid or solid. In this chapter, we will discuss several important properties of sound waves, including pressure wave and density wave. We will find that superposition of two sound waves differing slightly in frequency causes a phenomenon called beats. When a source of sound or a listener moves through the air, the listener may hear a different frequency than the one emitted by the source. This is the Doppler\u2019s effect. Note Sound wave (rather we can call audible sound wave) is a part of longitudinal wave with frequency varying from 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. 19.2 Displacement Wave, Pressure Wave and Density Wave Upto this point we have described mechanical waves primarily in terms of displacement. As we have discussed in chapter-17, a sinusoidal wave equation y x t ( , ) travelling in positive x-direction can be written as y x t A kx t ( , ) sin ( \u2013 ) = \u03c9 which gives the instantaneous displacement y of a particle in the medium at position x at time t. Note that in a longitudinal wave the displacements are parallel to the direction of motion of the wave. So, x and y are measured parallel to each other, not perpendicular as in a transverse wave. The amplitude A is the maximum displacement of a particle in a medium from its equilibrium position. These displacements are along the direction of the motion of the wave lead to variations in the density and pressure of air. Hence, a sound wave can also be described in terms of variations of pressure or density at various points. The pressure fluctuations are of the order of1 1 Pa N/m ), 2 (= whereas atmospheric pressure is about 105 Pa. In a sinusoidal sound wave in air, the pressure fluctuates above and below atmospheric pressure p0 with the same frequency as the motions of the air particles. Similarly, the density of air also vibrates sinusoidally above and below its normal level. So, we can express a sound wave either in terms of y x t ( , ) or \u2206p x t ( , ) or \u2206\u03c1 ( , ). x t All the three equations are related to one another. For example, amplitude of pressure variation ( ) \u2206p m is related to amplitude of displacement A by the equation, \u2206p BAk m = where B is the bulk modulus of the medium. Moreover, pressure or density wave is 90\u00b0 out of phase with the displacement wave, i.e. when the displacement is zero, the pressure and density changes are either maximum or minimum and when the displacement is a maximum or minimum, the pressure and density changes are zero. Now, let us find the relation between them. 100 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Relation between Displacement Wave and Pressure Wave Figure shows a harmonic displacement wave moving through air contained in a long tube of cross-sectional area S. The volume of gas that has a thickness \u2206x in the horizontal direction is V S x i = \u2206. The change in volume \u2206V is S y \u2206, where \u2206yis the difference between the value of yat x x + \u2206and the value of yat x. From the definition of bulk modulus, the pressure variation in the gas is \u2206 \u2206 p B V Vi = \u2013 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2013 B S y S x \u2206 \u2206 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2013 B y x \u2206 \u2206 As \u2206x approaches zero, the ratio \u2206 \u2206 y x becomes \u2202 \u2202 y x. (The partial derivative indicates that we are interested in the variation of y with position at a fixed time). Therefore, \u2206p B y x = \u2202 \u2202 \u2013 \u2026(i) So, this is the equation which relates the displacement equation with the pressure equation. Suppose the displacement equation is y A kx t = cos ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 \u2026(ii) Then, \u2202 \u2202= y x kA kx t \u2013 sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 \u2026(iii) and from Eqs. (i) and (iii), we find that \u2206 \u2206 p BAk kx t p kx t m = = sin ( \u2013 ) ( ) sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 \u03c9 \u2026(iv) Here, ( ) \u2206p BAk m = where \u2206pm is the amplitude of pressure variation. From Eqs. (ii) and (iv), we see that pressure equation is 90\u00b0 out of phase with displacement equation. When the displacement is zero, the pressure variation is either maximum or minimum and vice-versa. Fig. 19.2 (a) shows displacement from equilibrium of air molecules in a harmonic sound wave versus position at some instants. Points x1 and x3 are points of zero displacement. Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 101 a b \u2206x x x x + \u2206 V S x i = \u2206 a\u2032 b\u2032 y \u2206 \u2206 V S y = y y + \u2206 Fig. 19.1  Now, refer Fig. 19.2 (b) : Just to the left of x1, the displacement is negative indicating that the gas molecules are displaced to left away from point x1 at this instant. Just to the right of x1, the displacement is positive indicating that the molecules are displaced to the right, which is again away from point x1.So, at point x1 the pressure of the gas is minimum. So, if p0 is the atmospheric pressure (normal pressure), the pressure at x1 will be p x p p p BAk m ( ) \u2013 ( ) \u2013 1 0 0 = = \u2206 At point x3, the pressure (and hence the density also) is maximum because the molecules on both sides of that point are displaced toward point x3.Hence, p x p p p BAk m ( ) ( ) 3 0 0 = + = + \u2206 At point x2, the pressure (and hence the density) does not change because the gas molecules on both sides of that point have equal displacements in the same direction or p x p ( ) 2 0 = From Fig. 19.2 (a) and (c), we see that pressure change and displacement are 90\u00b0 out of phase. Relation between Pressure Wave and Density Wave In this section, we will find the relation between pressure wave and density wave. According to definition of bulk modulus ( ), B B dp dV V = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2013 / \u2026(i) 102 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics x x1 x2 x3 \u2013A +A y (a) x (b) p0 p BAk 0\u2013 p BAk 0+ (c) x Fig. 19.2  Further, volume mass density = or V m = \u03c1 or dV m d V d = \u22c5 = \u22c5 \u2013 \u2013 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 2 or dV V d = \u2013 \u03c1 \u03c1 Substituting in Eq. (i), we get d dp B dp v \u03c1 \u03c1 = = ( ) 2 v B B v = \u21d2 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u03c1 \u03c1 1 2 Or, this can be written as \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u03c1 \u03c1 = \u22c5 = \u22c5 B p v p 1 2 So, this relation relates the pressure equation with the density equation. For example, if \u2206 \u2206 p p kx t m = ( ) sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 then \u2206 \u2206 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c9 = ( ) sin ( \u2013 ) m kx t where, ( ) ( ) ( ) \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u03c1 \u03c1 m m m B p p v = = 2 Thus, density equation is in phase with the pressure equation and this is 90\u00b0 out of phase with the displacement equation. V Example 19.1 Corresponding to displacement equation, y A kx t = + sin( ) \u03c9 of a longitudinal wave make its pressure and density wave also. Bulk modulus of the medium is B and density is \u03c1. Solution Given, y x t A kx t ( , ) sin ( ) = + \u03c9 \u2202 \u2202 \u03c9 y x kA kx t = + cos ( ) \u2026(i) Now, pressure equation is given by \u2206p B y x = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2202 \u2202 Substituting the value of \u2202 \u2202 y x from Eq. (i), we have \u2206p BAk kx t = \u2212 + cos ( ) \u03c9 Ans. Similarly, density equation is given by ( ) ( ) \u2206 \u2206 p B p = \u03c1 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c1 \u2202 \u2202 B B y x = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c1 \u2202 \u2202 y x Substituting the values of \u2202 \u2202 y x from Eq.

Density of air = 1.29 kg/m3. 104 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 19.1  19.3 Speed of a Longitudinal Wave First we calculate the speed at which a longitudinal pulse propagates through a fluid. We will apply Newton\u2019s second law to the motion of an element of the fluid and from this we derive the wave equation. Consider a fluid element ab confined to a tube of cross-sectional area S as shown in figure. The element has a thickness \u2206x.We assume that the equilibrium pressure of the fluid is p0.Because of the disturbance, the section \u2018a\u2019 of the element moves a distance y from its mean position and section \u2018b\u2019 moves a distance y y + \u2206to a new position b\u2032. The pressure on the left side of the element becomes p p 0 1 + \u2206 and on the right side it becomes p p 0 2 + \u2206 . If \u03c1 is the equilibrium density, the mass of the element is \u03c1S x \u2206. (When the element moves its mass does not change, even though its volume and density do change). The net force acting on the element is F p p S = ( \u2013 ) \u2206 \u2206 1 2 and its acceleration is a y t = \u2202 \u2202 2 2 Thus, Newton\u2019s second law applied to the motion of the element is ( \u2013 ) \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 p p S ma S x y t 1 2 2 2 = = \u2202 \u2202 \u03c1 \u2026(i) Next we divide both sides by \u2206x and note that in the limit as \u2206x \u21920, we have ( \u2013 ) / \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 p p x p x 1 2 \u2192\u2202 \u2202 / , Eq.

When a longitudinal wave propagates in a solid rod or bar, the rod expands sideways slightly when it is compressed longitudinally and the speed of a longitudinal wave in a rod is given by v Y = \u03c1 (speed of a longitudinal wave in a solid rod) 19.4 Sound Waves in Gases In the preceding section, we derived equation v B = /\u03c1 for the speed of longitudinal waves in a fluid of bulk modulus B and density\u03c1.We use this to find the speed of sound in an ideal gas. The bulk modulus of the gas, however depends on the process. When a wave travels through a gas, are the compressions and expansions adiabatic, or is there enough heat conduction between adjacent layers of gas to maintain a nearly constant temperature throughout? Because thermal conductivities of gases are very small, it turns out that for ordinary sound frequencies (20 Hz to 20,000 Hz) propagation of sound is very nearly adiabatic. Thus, in the above equation, we use the adiabatic bulk modulus ( ) Bs , which is given by B p s = \u03b3 Here, \u03b3 is the ratio of molar heat capacity C C p V / .Thus, v p = \u03b3 \u03c1 We can get a useful alternative form of the above equation by substituting density \u03c1 of an ideal gas \u03c1 = pM ",

From this it is clear that if the temperature of the gas remains constant, then there is no effect of the pressure change on the speed of sound. (iii) Effect of humidity The density of moist air (i.e. air mixed with water-vapour) is less than the density of dry air. This is because in moist air heavy dust particles settle down due to condensation. Hence, density of air gets decreased thus increasing the speed of sound.

Assume an air density of 1.29 kg/m3 and a velocity of sound is 345 m/s. Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 111 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 19.3  19.6 Interference in Sound Wave and Stationary Wave In chapter 18, we have already discussed about the principle of superposition, interference and stationary wave. In the similar manner, we can make stationary waves with longitudinal (or sound) waves also. When two identical sound waves travel in opposite directions, then by their superposition (and hence interference) longitudinal stationary waves are formed. But, as we know that, with every longitudinal travelling wave three equations are associated y x t ( , ), \u2206P x t ( , ) and \u2206\u03c1 ( , ) x t . So, with every longitudinal stationary wave three equations are associated, y x t ( , ), \u2206P x t ( , ) and \u2206\u03c1 ( , ) x t . Following three points are important with longitudinal stationary wave : (i) If individual displacement amplitudes of constituent travelling waves are A0 each, then displacement amplitude in stationary wave varies from 0 to 2 0 A . (ii) If two identical (same frequency) longitudinal waves travel in opposite directions, standing waves are produced by their superposition. If the equations of the two waves are written as \u2206 \u2206 p p kx t m 1 = ( ) sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 and \u2206 \u2206 p p kx t m 2 = + ( ) sin ( ) \u03c9 then from the principle of superposition, the resultant wave is \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 p p p p kx t m = + = 1 2 2 ( ) sin cos \u03c9 \u2026(i) This equation is similar to the equation obtained in chapter 18 for standing waves on a string. From Eq. (i), we can see that \u2206p = 0 at x = \u2026 0 2 , , , , \u03bb/ \u03bb etc. (pressure nodes) and \u2206p x = = \u2026 maximum at etc. \u03bb/ \u03bb/ 4 3 4 , , , (pressure antinodes) The distance between two adjacent nodes or between two adjacent antinodes is \u03bb/2.Longitudinal standing waves can be produced in air columns trapped in tubes of cylindrical shape. Organ pipes are such vibrating air columns. (iii) Because the pressure wave is 90\u00b0 out of phase with the displacement wave. Consequently, the displacement node behaves as a pressure antinode and vice-versa. This can be explained by realizing that two small volume elements of fluid on opposite sides of a displacement node are vibrating in opposite phase. Hence, when they approach each other [ ] see Fig. (a) the pressure at this node is a maximum, and when they recede from each other, [ ] see Fig. (b) the pressure at this node is a minimum. Similarly, two small elements of fluid which are on opposite sides of a displacement antinode vibrate in phase and therefore give rise to no pressure variations at the antinode [see Fig. (c)]. 112 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics A A (c) N N N N N N (a) (b) Fig. 19.4  \u0098 Most of the problems of interference can be solved by calculating the path difference \u2206x and then by putting \u2206x = \u2026 0 2 , , , \u03bb \u03bb (constructive interference) \u2206x = \u2026 \u03bb \u03bb 2 3 2 , (destructive interference) provided the waves emitted from S1 and S2 are in phase. \u0098 If the two waves emitted from S1 and S2 have already a phase difference of \u03c0, the conditions of maximas and minimas are interchanged, i.e. path difference \u2206x = \u2026 \u03bb \u03bb 2 3 2 , (for constructive interference) and \u2206x = \u2026 \u03bb \u03bb , , 2 (for destructive interference) V Example 19.9 Two sound sources S1 and S2 emit pure sinusoidal waves in phase.

The superposition of the waves travelling in opposite directions forms a longitudinal standing wave. Transverse waves on a string, including standing waves, are usually described only in terms of the displacement of the string. But longitudinal standing waves in a fluid may be described either in terms of the displacement of the fluid or in terms of the pressure variation in the fluid. To avoid confusion we will use the terms displacement node and displacement antinode to refer to points where particles of the fluid have zero displacement and maximum displacement respectively. Similarly, pressure node and pressure antinode refer to the points where pressure and density variation in the fluid is zero or maximum, respectively. Conditions at the Boundary of an Organ Pipe Let us take an example of a closed organ pipe. In a closed pipe one end is closed and the other is open. When a longitudinal wave encounters the closed end of the pipe it gets reflected from this end. But the reflected wave is 180\u00b0 out of phase with the incident wave, i.e. a compression is reflected as a compression and a rarefaction is reflected as a rarefaction. This is a necessary condition because the displacement of the small volume elements at the closed end must always be zero. Hence, a closed end is a displacement node. A sound wave is also reflected from an open end. You may wonder how a sound wave can reflect from an open end, since there may not appear to be a change in the medium at this point. At the open end pressure is the same as atmospheric pressure and does not vary. Thus, there is a pressure node (or displacement antinode) at this end. A compression is therefore reflected as a rarefaction and rarefaction as a compression. Now let us see how this reflection takes place. When a rarefaction reaches an open end, the surrounding air rushes towards this region and creates a compression that travels back along the pipe. Similarly, when a compression reaches an open end, the air expands to form a rarefaction. This can be said in a different way as : at the open end of the tube, fluid elements are free to move, so there is a displacement antinode. Thus, in a nutshell we can say that closed end of 114 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 19.4  an organ pipe is a displacement node or pressure antinode and open end of the pipe is displacement antinode or pressure node. Similarly, both ends of an open organ pipe (open at both ends) are displacement antinodes or pressure nodes. Standing Waves in a Closed Organ Pipe To get resonance in a closed organ pipe sound waves are sent in by a source (normally a tuning fork) near the open end. Resonance corresponds to a pressure antinode at the closed end and a pressure node at the open end. The standing wave patterns for the three lowest harmonics in this situation are shown in figure. Since the node-antinode separation is \u03bb 4 , the resonance condition for the first harmonic is, l = \u03bb1 4 . Similarly, the resonance conditions for the higher harmonics are l = \u2026 3 4 5 4 2 3 \u03bb \u03bb , , , etc. or, \u03bb n l n = 4 (where n =1 3 5 , , K).

Thus, in a pipe closed at one end and open at the other, the natural frequencies of oscillation form a harmonic series that includes only odd integer multiples of the fundamental frequency. Standing Waves in an Open Organ Pipe Since both ends of the tube are open, there are pressure nodes (or displacement antinodes) at both ends.

A compression reaching an open end does not reflect until it passes beyond the end. For a thin walled tube of circular cross-section, this end correction is approximately 0.6 r where r is the tube\u2019s radius. Hence, the effective length of the tube is longer than the true length l. Therefore, Laplace correction e r = 0.6 (in closed pipe) and 2e r = 1.2 (in open pipe) Hence, f n v l r = + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 2( ) 1.2 (in open pipe) and f n v l r = + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 4 0 6 ( . ) (in closed pipe) However, we neglect this small correction if the length of the tube is much larger than its diameter. \u0098 If an open pipe and a closed pipe are of same lengths, then fundamental frequency of open pipe = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 v l 2 is two times the fundamental frequency of closed pipe = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 v l4 . \u0098 In the above equations v is the speed of constituent longitudinal waves by which stationary wave is formed.

In standing waves, amplitude is a function of distance. This illustrates a type of interference that we can call interference in space. The same principle of superposition leads us to another type of interference, which we can call interference in time. It occurs when two wavetrains of slightly different frequency travel through the same region.

But at some later time (say t t = 0), because the frequencies are different, the waves will be out of phase or the interference will be destructive and the resultant amplitude will be A A 1 2 \u2013 ( ) if A A 1 2 > . Later, we will see that the time t0 is 1 2 1 2 ( \u2013 ) . f f Thus, the resultant amplitude oscillates between A A 1 2 + and A A 1 2 \u2013 with a time period T t f f = = 2 1 0 1 2 \u2013 or with a frequency f f f = 1 2 \u2013 known as beat frequency.

On the other hand, when tuning fork is filed, its frequency increases. 120 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  V Example 19.14 Two tuning forks A and B produce 6 beats per second. Frequency of A is 300 Hz. When B is slightly loaded with wax, beat frequency decreases. Find original frequency of B. Solution Since, A and B produce 6 beats per second. Therefore, original frequency of B may be 306 Hz or 294 Hz. When B is loaded with wax, its frequency will decrease (suppose it decreases by 1Hz). So, if it is 306Hz, it will become 305Hz. If it is 294 Hz, it will become 293Hz. Frequency of A is unchanged ( ) = 300Hz . If fB becomes 305Hz, then beat frequency will become 5Hz. If fB becomes 293Hz, then it will become 7Hz. But in the question it is given that beat frequency has decreased. So, the correct answer is 306Hz. V Example 19.15 The string of a violin emits a note of 400 Hz at its correct tension. The string is bit taut and produces 5 beats per second with a tuning fork of frequency 400 Hz. Find frequency of the note emitted by this taut string. Solution The frequency of vibration of a string increases with increase in the tension. Thus, the note emitted by the string will be a little more than 400 Hz. As it produces 5 beats per second with the 440 Hz tuning fork, the frequency will be 405 Hz. V Example 19.16 Two tuning forks P and Q when set vibrating, give 4 beats per second. If a prong of the fork P is filed, the beats are reduced to 2 per second. Determine the original frequency of P, if that of Q is 250 Hz. Solution There are four beats between P and Q, therefore the possible frequencies of P are 246 or 254 (that is 250 4 \u00b1 ) Hz. When the prong of P is filed, its frequency becomes greater than the original frequency. If we assume that the original frequency of P is 254, then on filing its frequency will be greater than 254. The beats between P and Q will be more than 4. But it is given that the beats are reduced to 2, therefore, 254 is not possible. Therefore, the required frequency must be 246 Hz. (This is true, because on filing the frequency may increase to 248, giving 2 beats with Q of frequency 250 Hz) Ans. 1. A tuning fork produces 4 beats per second with another tuning fork of frequency 256 Hz. The first one is now loaded with a little wax and the beat frequency is found to increase to 6 per second. What was the original frequency of the first tuning fork? 2. A tuning fork of unknown frequency makes three beats per second with a standard fork of frequency 384 Hz. The beat frequency decreases when a small piece of wax is put on a prong of the first fork. What is the frequency of this fork? Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 121 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 19.6  19.9 The Doppler\u2019s Effect If a wave source and a receiver are moving relative to each other, the frequency observed by the receiver ( f \u2032) is different from the actual source frequency ( ) f . This phenomenon is called the Doppler\u2019s effect, named after the Austrian physicist Christian Johann Doppler (1803\u20131853), who discovered it in light waves. Perhaps you might have noticed how the sound of a vehicle\u2019s horn changes as the vehicle moves past you. The frequency (pitch) of the sound you hear as the vehicle approaches you is higher than the frequency you hear as it moves away from you. The Doppler\u2019s effect applies to waves in general. Let us apply it to sound waves. We consider the special case in which the source and observer move along the line joining them. We will use the following symbols, v = speed of sound, vs = speed of source and vo = speed of observer and vm = velocity of medium in which sound travels. For example, if Doppler\u2019s effect is observed in air, it is wind velocity. If Doppler\u2019s effect is observed inside a river, then it is river velocity. The general formula of the changed frequency is f v v v v v v f m o m s \u2032 = \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 Sign Convention vm We are talking about that sound which is travelling from source to observer (S to O). If the medium is also travelling in the same direction, then it means medium is supporting the sound. So, take positive sign both in numerator and denominator. If the medium travels in opposite direction, then take negative sign. If nothing is given in the question, then take it zero. vo andvs The concept is approaching nature always increases the frequency. So, take positive sign with vo (because it is in numerator) and negative sign with vs (as it is in denominator). On the other hand, receding nature decreases the frequency. So, take negative sign with vo and positive sign with vs. Now, let us make some different cases. Case 1 In the given figure, sound is travelling from right to left but wind is blowing from left to right, so we will have to take negative sign with wind velocity. Observer is approaching towards source, so take positive sign with vo . Source is receding from the observer, so take positive sign with vs. The correct formula is given below f v v v v v v f o s \u2032 = \u2212 + \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 wind wind 122 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics O vo S vs Wind Sound Fig. 19.10  Case 2 Sound and wind both are travelling in the same direction (from S to O), so take positive sign with wind velocity. Source and observer both are approaching towards each other. So, take positive sign with vo and negative sign with vs. Therefore, the correct formula is f v v v v v v f o s \u2032 = + + + \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 wind wind Now, let us derive two special cases when medium velocity is zero. Source at Rest, Observer Moves Suppose that the observer O moves towards the source S at speed vo .The speed of the sound waves relative to O is v v v r o = + , but wavelength has its normal value \u03bb = v f .Thus, the frequency heard by O is f v v v v f r o \u2032 = = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03bb If O were moving away from S, the frequency heard by O would be f v v v f o \u2032 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2013 Combining these two expressions, we find f v v v f o \u2032 = \u00b1 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2026(i) Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 123 O S Wind Sound Fig. 19.11 S O S v v v v \u03bb o o Fig. 19.12  Source Moves, Observer at Rest Suppose that the source S moves towards O as shown in figure. If S were at rest, the distance between two consecutive wave pulses emitted by sound would be \u03bb = = v f vT. However, in one time period S moves a distance v T s before it emits the next pulse. As a result the wavelength is modified. Directly ahead of S the effective wavelength (for both S and O) is \u03bb\u2032 = = \u2212 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 vT v T v v T v v f s s s \u2013 ( ) \u2013 The speed of sound waves relative to O is simply v. Thus, the frequency observed by O is f v v v v f s \u2032 = \u2032 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03bb \u2013 If S were moving away from O, the effective wavelength would be \u03bb\u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 v v f s and the apparent frequency would be f v v v f s \u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 Combining these two results, we have f v v v f s \u2032 = \u00b1 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2026(ii) All four possibilities can be combined into one equation f v v v v f o s \u2032 = \u00b1 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 m \u2026(iii) where the upper signs (+ numerator, \u2013 denominator) correspond to the source and observer along the line joining the two in the direction toward the other, and the lower signs in the direction away from the other. 124 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics The wavelength in front of the source is less than the normal whereas in the rear it is larger than normal. S v vs \u03bb\u2032 O \u03bb\u2032 Fig. 19.14 S O vs Fig. 19.13  Alternate Method The above formulae can be derived alternately as discussed below. Assume that the source and observer are moving along the same line and that the observer O is to the right of the source S. Suppose that at time t = 0, when the source and the observer are separated by a distance SO l = , the source emits a wave pulse (say p1) that reaches the observer at a later time t1.In that time the observer has moved a distance v t o 1 and the total distance travelled by p1 in the time t1 has been l v t o + 1.If v is the speed of sound, this distance is also vt1.Then, vt l v t 1 0 1 = + or t l v v 1 0 = \u2013 \u2026(iv) At time t T = , the source is at S\u2032 and the wave pulse (say p2) emitted at this time will reach the observer at a time say t2, measured from the same time t = 0, as before. The total distance travelled by p2 till it is received by the observer (measured from S \u2032) is ( \u2013 ) . l v T v t s o + 2 The actual travel time for p2 is ( \u2013 ) t T 2 and the distance travelled is v t T ( \u2013 ). 2 Therefore, v t T l v T v t s ( \u2013 ) ( \u2013 ) 2 0 2 = + or t l v v T v v s o 2 = + ( \u2013 ) \u2013 \u2026(v) The time interval reckoned by the observer between the two pulses emitted by the source at S and at S \u2032is T t t v v v v T s o \u2032 = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 1 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 This is really the changed time period as observed by the observer. Hence, the new frequency is f T v v v v T o s \u2032 = \u2032 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 1 \u2013 \u2013 or f v v v v f o s \u2032 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2013 \u2013 This is a result which we can expect by using equation f v v v v f o s \u2032 = \u00b1 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 m in the case when source is moving towards observer and observer is moving away from the source. Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 125 O S O\u2032 vs vo S\u2032 v T s v t o 1 l Fig. 19.15  \u0098 We have derived equation number (iii) by assuming that vo and v s are along the line joining source and observer. If the motion is along some other direction, the components of velocities along the line joining source and observer are considered. For example in the figure shown, f v v v v f o s \u2032 = + + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 cos cos \u03b8 \u03b8 \u0098 Change in frequency depends on the fact that whether the source is moving towards the observer or the observer is moving towards the source. But when the speed of source and observer are much lesser than that of sound, the change in frequency becomes independent of the fact whether the source is moving or the observer. This can be shown as under. Suppose a source is moving towards a stationary observer, with speedu and the speed of sound is v,then f v v u f u v f \u2032 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2013 \u2013 1 1 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 1 \u2013 \u2013 u v f Using the binomial expansion, we have 1 1 1 \u2013 \u2013 u v u v \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2248 + if u v << \u2234 f u v f \u2032 \u2248 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 if u v << On the other hand, if an observer moves towards a stationary source with same speed u, then f v u v f u v f \u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 which is same as above. \u0098 As long as v s and vo are along the line joiningS andO, Doppler\u2019s effect (or change in frequency) does not depend on the distance between S and O. For example in the given figure, f f v v v o \u2032= + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 f f \u2032> but it is constant and independent of \u2018d\u2019. \u0098 Frequency is given by f v = \u03bb By the motion of source, \u03bb changes, therefore frequency changes. But, from the motion of observer, relative velocity v between sound and observer changes, therefore frequency changes. \u0098 Despite the motion of source or observer (or both), Doppler\u2019s effect is not observed (or f f \u2032= ) under the following four conditions. 126 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics O v0 S d Fig. 19.17 Extra Points to Remember \u03b8 \u03b8 v0 O S vs Fig. 19.16  Condition 1 v s or vo is making an angle of 90\u00b0 with the line joining S and O.

What is the lowest and highest frequency heard by an observer a long distance away at rest with respect to the centre of circle? Take speed of sound in air as 330 m/s.

One fork moves away from the observer while the other moves towards him at the same speed. The observer hears beats of frequency 3 Hz. Find the speed of the tuning fork (velocity of sound in air is 340 m/s). Note The difference in apparent frequencies is very small (3 Hz).

The fundamental frequency of the closed organ pipe is 110 Hz. Find the lengths of the pipes. Speed of sound in air v m s = 330 / . Solution Let l1 and l2 be the lengths of closed and open pipes respectively. Fundamental frequency of closed organ pipe is given by f v l 1 4 = where v is speed of sound in air and 330 m/s equal to But, f1 110 = Hz (given) Therefore, v l 4 110 1 = Hz \u2234 l v 1 4 110 330 4 110 = \u00d7 = \u00d7 = m 0.75 m Solved Examples  First overtone of closed organ pipe will be f f 3 1 3 3 110 330 = = = ( ) Hz Hz This produces a beat frequency of 2.2 Hz with first overtone of open organ pipe.

Ans. V Example 2 A vibrating string of certain length l under a tensionT resonates with a mode corresponding to the first overtone (third harmonic) of an air column of length 75 cm inside a tube closed at one end. The string also generates 4 beats/s with a tuning fork of frequency n. Now when the tension of the string is slightly increased the number of beats reduces to 2 per second. Assuming the velocity of sound in air to be 340 m/s, the frequency n of the tuning fork in Hz is (JEE 2008) (a) 344 (b) 336 (c) 117.3 (d) 109.3 Solution With increase in tension, frequency of vibrating string will increase. Since, number of beats are decreasing. Therefore, frequency of vibrating string or third harmonic frequency of closed pipe should be less than the frequency of tuning fork by 4. \u2234 Frequency of tuning fork = third harmonic frequency of closed pipe + 4 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7+ = \u00d7 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7+ 3 4 4 3 340 4 0 75 4 v l . =344 Hz \u2234Correct option is (a). V Example 3 Two identical straight wires are stretched so as to produce 6 beats/s when vibrating simultaneously. On changing the tension slightly in one of them, the beat frequency remains unchanged. Denoting by T T 1 2 , the higher and the lower initial tension in the strings, then it could be said that while making the above changes in tension (JEE 1991) (a) T2 was decreased (b) T2 was increased (c) T1 was decreased (d) T1 was increased 132 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Solution T T 1 2 > \u2234 v v 1 2 > or f f 1 2 > and f f 1 2 6 \u2212 = Hz Now, if T1 is increased, f1 will increase or f f 1 2 \u2212 will increase. Therefore, (d) option is wrong. If T1 is decreased, f1 will decrease and it may be possible that now f f 2 1 \u2212 become 6 Hz.Therefore, (c) option is correct. Similarly, when T2 is increased, f2 will increase and again f f 2 1 \u2212 may become equal to 6 Hz. So, (b) is also correct. But (a) is wrong.

The vibrating portion of the sonometer wire has a length of 10 cm and mass of 1 g. The vibrating tuning fork is now moved away from the vibrating wire with a constant speed and an observer standing near the sonometer hears one beat per second.

Type 2. Reflection of a sound from a wall and beats Concept A source of sound is approaching towards a wall. An observer hears two sounds. One is direct from the source and the other reflected from wall. If both frequencies are same, then the observer will hear no beats and if there is a frequency difference then beats are heard to Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 133 S O Wall  the observer. This all depends on the position of observer. For finding the frequency of reflected sound we have the following two approaches. Approach 1 Take wall as a plane mirror. Image of S on this plane mirror will behave like another source S\u2032 for the reflected sound. For example, in the shown figure both direct sound source S and reflected sound source S\u2032 are approaching towards the observer. Approach 2 First consider wall as an observer for the sound received to it from the source S. Now, consider this wall as a source for reflected sound. V Example 5 A siren emitting a sound of frequency 1000 Hz moves away from you toward a cliff at a speed of 10 m/s. (a) What is the frequency of the sound you hear coming directly from the siren? (b) What is the frequency of the sound you hear reflected off the cliff? (c) What beat frequency would you hear? Take the speed of sound in air as 330 m/s. Solution The situation is as shown in figure. (a) Frequency of sound reaching directly to us (by S) f v v vs 1 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 f = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 330 330 10 1000 ( ) = 970.6 Hz Ans. (b) Frequency of sound which is reflected from the cliff (from S\u2032 ) f v v v f s 2 330 330 10 1000 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2013 \u2013 ( ) = 1031.3 Hz Ans. (c) Beat frequency = f f 2 1 \u2013 = 60.7 Hz Ans. Note Numerically the beat frequency comes out to be 60.7 Hz . But, beats between two tones can be detected by ear upto a frequency of about 7 per second. At higher frequencies beats cannot be distinguished in the sound produced. Hence, the correct answer of part (c) should be zero. 134 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics S O Wall S\u2032 S S' O Cliff  V Example 6 A source of sound of frequency f is approaching towards a wall with speed vs. Speed of sound is v. Three observers O1, O2 and O3 are at different locations as shown. Find the beat frequency as observed by three different observers. Solution For reflected sound we can take wall as a plane mirror. Observer O1 S is receding from O1 and S\u2032 is approaching towards him. So, f f s s \u2032 > f f f b s s = \u2212 \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 f v v v f v v v s s = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 2 2 2 vv v v f s s Ans. Observer O2 O2 has no relative motion with S. Therefore, there will be no change in the frequency of direct sound from S. Further, O2 and S\u2032 are approaching towards each other. Therefore, the frequency of reflected sound will increase. f f f b s s = \u2212 \u2032 = + \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u2212 f v v v v f o s 2 But v v o s 2 = \u2234 f f v v v v f b s s = + \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u2212 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2v v v f s s Ans. Observer O3 S and S\u2032 both are approaching towards O3. So, both frequencies will increase. But after the increase they are equal. So, beat frequency will be zero. f f f v v v s s s = \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2234 f f f b s s = \u2212 \u2032 =0 Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 135 ",

Type 3. Based on the experiment of finding speed of sound using resonance tube Concept (i) If a vibrating tuning fork (of known frequency) is held over the open end of a resonance tube, then resonance is obtained at some position as the level of water is lowered. If eis the end correction of the tube and l1 is the length from the water level to the top of the tube, then 136 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics l1 e \u03bb\u20144 l2 e 3\u20144 \u03bb (i) (ii) C O v Sound  l e 1 4 + = \u03bb \u2026(i) Now, the water level is further lowered until a resonance is again obtained. If l2 is new length of the air column, then l e 2 3 4 + = \u03bb \u2026(ii) Subtracting Eq. (i) from Eq. (ii), we get l l 2 1 2 \u2212 = \u03bb or \u03bb = \u2212 = 2 2 1 ( ) l l v f \u03bb = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 v f \u2234 v f l l = \u2212 2 2 1 ( ) (ii) The above result is independent of the end correction e. (iii) In the above two figures v, \u03bb, f and loop size = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03bb 2 are same in both figures. Length of closed organ pipe is different. In the second figure, length is more. So, the fundamental frequency f v l = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 4 will be less. Suppose frequency of given tuning fork is 300 Hz. Then, fundamental frequency of first pipe is also 300Hz. But fundamental frequency of the second pipe should be 100 Hz. So, that its next higher frequency (or first overtone frequency) which is three times the fundamental( ) = \u00d7 = 3 100 300Hz should also be in resonance with the given tuning fork. V Example 8 A tuning fork of 512 Hz is used to produce resonance in a resonance tube experiment. The level of water at first resonance is 30.7 cm and at second resonance is 63.2 cm. The error in calculating velocity of sound is (JEE 2005) (a) 204.1 cm/s (b) 110 cm/s (c) 58 cm/s (d) 280 cm/s Solution Actual speed of sound in air is 330 m/s \u03bb 2 2 1 = \u2212 = \u2212 = = ( ) ( ) l l 63.2 30.7 cm 32.5 cm 0.325 m or \u03bb = 0.65 m \u2234 Speed of sound observed, v f 0 512 = = \u00d7 = \u03bb 0.65 332.8 m/s \u2234 Error in calculating velocity of sound = 2.8 m/s = 280 cm/s \u2234The correct option is (d). V Example 9 In the experiment for the determination of the speed of sound in air using the resonance column method, the length of the air column that resonates in the fundamental mode, with a tuning fork is 0.1 m. When this length is changed to 0.35 m, the same tuning fork resonates with the first overtone. Calculate the end correction. (JEE 2003) (a) 0.012 m (b) 0.025 m (c) 0.05 m (d) 0.024 m Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 137  Solution Let e be the  end correction. Given that, fundamental tone for a length 0.1m = first overtone for the length 0.35 m. v e v e 4 3 4 ( ) ( ) 0.1 0.35 + = + Solving this equation, we get e = = 0.025m 2.5 cm. \u2234The correct option is (b). Alternate method l e 2 3 4 + = \u03bb/ and l e 1 4 + = \u03bb/ Solving these two equations, we get e l l = \u2212 = \u2212 \u00d7 = 2 1 3 2 3 2 0.35 0.1 0.025 m V Example 10 A student is performing the experiment of resonance column. The diameter of the column tube is 4 cm. The frequency of the tuning fork is 512 Hz. The air temperature is 38\u00b0 C in which the speed of sound is 336 m/s. The zero of the meter scale coincides with the top end of the resonance column tube. When the first resonance occurs, the reading of the water level in the column is (JEE 2012) (a) 14.0 cm (b) 15.2 cm (c) 16.4 cm (d) 17.6 cm Solution With end correction, f n v l e = + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 4 ( ) , (where, n = 1 3 , , \u2026) = + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa n v l r 4 ( ) 0.6 Because, e r = 0.6 , where r is radius of pipe.

Type 4. Based on a situation which is similar to Doppler\u2019s effect Concept Let us take an example. A belt shown in figure is moving with velocity 5 m/s. Child-1 is placing some coins over the belt at a regular interval of 1sec. Child -2 is receiving the coins on the other hand. Now, let us compare this situation with Doppler\u2019s effect. 138 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics Child-2 Child-1 5 m/s  Child-1 is source, child-2 is observer, velocity of belt is net velocity of sound ( ) = \u00b1 v vm by which sound travels from source to observer. Actually, in this case v = velocity of coin (similar to velocity of sound) = 0 vm = velocity of medium (or velocity of belt) = 5m/s T = time interval of placing two successive coins = 1sec \u2234 f T = = 1 number of coins placed per second \u03bb = distance between two coins = = v T m 5m. Now, let us consider the different cases. Case 1 When source (child-1) and observer (child-2) both are at rest only belt (or medium) is in motion. In this case, distance between two coins moving towards child-2 with 5m/s is 5m. If child-2 receives first coin at time t1 0 = , then he will receive the second coin at t2 5 5 1 = = m m/s sec. \u2234 T\u2032 = time interval of receival of two successive coins = \u2212 = t t 2 1 1 sec \u2234 f T \u2032 = \u2032 = 1 1Hz Result By the motion of only medium, there is no change in frequency. Case 2 If child-1 (or source) starts moving towards child-2 with 2 m/s. Then, in T =1sec, belt will move a distance of 5m towards child-2 and child-1 will also travel a distance of 2m towards child-2 at the time of placing the second coin. Hence, \u03bb = new distance between two successive coins = \u2212 = ( ) 5 2 3 m m Now, if child-2 receives the first coin at time t1 0 = , then he will receive the second coin (at a distance of 3m from first coin) moving towards him with 5 m/s at time t2 3 5 = sec. \u2234 T t t \u2032= \u2212 = 2 1 3 5 sec or f T \u2032= \u2032 = 1 5 3 Hz or f f \u2032> Result By the motion of source only wavelength changes therefore frequency changes. Case 3 Child-1 (or source) is stationary and child-2 starts moving towards child-1 with 2 m/s. This time, \u03bb = distance between two successive coins is unchanged or 5 m. But coins and child-2 are moving towards each other with 5 m/s and 2 m/s, respectively. Therefore, relative velocity between them is 7m/s. So, if child-2 receives the first coin at time t1 0 = , then he will receive the second coin at time t2 5 7 = sec \u2234 T t t \u2032 = \u2212 = 2 1 5 7 sec or f T \u2032 = \u2032 = 1 7 5 Hz or f f \u2032> Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 139  Result By the motion of observer relative velocity between sound and observer changes. Therefore, frequency changes. Note In case-2, f Hz \u2032 = 5 3 and in case-3, f Hz \u2032 = 7 5 . These two are not same, although speeds are same in both cases but change in frequency is different. Type 5. When v s or v o are not along the line joining S and O but they are very far from each other. Concept In this case, we take components of vs and vo along the line SO. For example in the figure shown below, f f v v vs \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 cos\u03b8 If source is very far from observer, then \u03b8\u2192\u00b0 0 or cos\u03b8\u21921 \u2234 f f v v vs \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 V Example 11 A source of frequency f is moving towards the observer along the line SO with a constant velocity vs as shown in figure. Plot f \u2032 versus t graph. Where f \u2032 is the changed frequency observed by the observer. Solution During approach f f v v v f s \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= 1 (say) f f \u2032 > but f\u2032 is constant with time. During recede f f v v v f s \u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= 2 (say) f f \u2032 < but f\u2032 is constant with time. The correct f\u2032 versus t graph is as shown. In the figure, to is the time when source is crossing the observer. 140 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics vs vs cos\u03b8 \u03b8 O f\u2032 f1 f f2 t to vs O S  V Example 12 Repeat example-11 if source does not move along the line SO. Solution The changed frequency f\u2032 is now, f f v v vs \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 cos\u03b8 This time f\u2032 is not constant but it is a function of \u03b8, which is variable. But, at a far distance, \u03b8\u2192\u00b0 0 or cos\u03b8\u21921 or \u2234 f f v v vs \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 and this is the maximum value of f\u2032 (say fmax) At point P, \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 \u2234 f f \u2032 = During receding (to the right of P) f f v v vs \u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 cos\u03b8 Again, at large distance from P, \u03b8\u2192\u00b0 0 or cos\u03b8\u21921 \u2234 f f v v vs \u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 This time, this is the minimum value of f\u2032 (say fmin). Hence, f\u2032 varies from fmax to fmin, with f f \u2032 = at the time of crossing P. The correct f\u2032 versus t graph is as shown below. V Example 13 A whistle emitting a sound of frequency 440 Hz is tied to a string of 1.5 m length and rotated with an angular velocity of 20 rad/s in the horizontal plane. Calculate the range of frequencies heard by an observer stationed at a large distance from the whistle. (Speed of sound = 330 m/s). (JEE 1996) Solution vs = Speed of source (whistle) = R\u03c9 = ( ) ( ) 1.5 20 m/s, vs = 30 m/s Maximum frequency will be heard by the observer in position P and minimum in position Q. Chapter 19 Sound Waves \u0097 141 vs \u03b8 O S P 90\u00b0 fmax t fmin f \u2032 f tp  Now, f f v v vs max = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 where, v = speed of sound in air = 330 m/s = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ( ) 440 330 330 30 Hz or fmax = 484 Hz and f f v v vs min = + \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ( ) 440 330 330 30 fmin = 403.33 Hz Therefore, range of frequencies heard by observer is from 484 Hz to 403.33 Hz. V Example 14 The water level in a vertical glass tube 1.0 m long can be adjusted to any position in the tube. A tuning fork vibrating at 660 Hz is held just over the open top end of the tube. At what positions of the water level will there be in resonance? Speed of sound is 330 m/s. Solution Resonance corresponds to a pressure antinode at closed end and pressure node at open end. Further, the distance between a pressure node and a pressure antinode is \u03bb 4 , the condition of resonance would be, Length of air column l n n v f = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03bb 4 4 Here, n = \u2026 1 3 5 , , , l1 1 330 4 660 = \u00d7 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= ( ) 0.125 m l l 2 1 3 = = 0.375 m l l 3 1 5 = = 0.625 m l l 4 1 7 = = 0.875 m l l 5 1 9 = = 1.125 m Since, l5 1 > m (the length of tube), the length of air columns can have the values from l1 to l4 only. 142 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics O P Q vs Miscellaneous Examples  Therefore, level of water at resonance will be ( \u2013 1.0 0.125 m 0.875 m ) = ( \u2013 ) 1.0 0.375 m 0.625 m = ( \u2013 ) 1.0 0.625 m 0.375 m = and ( \u2013 ) 1.0 0.875 m 0.125 m = Ans. In all the four cases shown in figure, the resonance frequency is 660 Hz but first one is the fundamental tone or first harmonic. Second is first overtone or third harmonic and so on. V Example 15 A tube 1.0 m long is closed at one end. A stretched wire is placed near the open end. The wire is 0.3 m long and has a mass of 0.01 kg. It is held fixed at both ends and vibrates in its fundamental mode. It sets the air column in the tube into vibration at its fundamental frequency by resonance. Find (a) the frequency of oscillation of the air column and (b) the tension in the wire. Speed of sound in air = 330 m s / .

The sound is detected by moving a detector on the screen at a distance D ( ) >> \u03bb from the slit S1 as shown in figure. Find the distance y such that the intensity at P is equal to intensity at O. Solution At point O on the screen the path difference between the sound waves reaching from S1 and S2 is 2\u03bb, i.e. constructive interference is obtained at O. At a very large distance from point O on the screen the path difference is zero. Thus, we can conclude that as we move away from point O on the screen path difference decreases from 2\u03bb to zero. At O constructive interference is obtained (where \u2206x = 2\u03bb). So, next constructive interference will be obtained where \u2206x = \u03bb. Hence, ",

All thermometers are based on the principle that some physical properties of a system change as the system\u2019s temperature changes. Some physical properties that change with temperature are 1. the volume of a liquid 2. the length of a solid 3. the pressure of a gas at constant volume 4. the volume of a gas at constant pressure and 5. the electric resistance of a conductor. A common thermometer in everyday use consists of a mass of liquid, usually mercury or alcohol that expands in a glass capillary tube when heated. In this case, the physical property is the change in volume of the liquid. Any temperature change is proportional to the change in length of the liquid column. The thermometer can be calibrated accordingly. On the celsius temperature scale, a thermometer is usually calibrated between 0\u00b0C (called the ice point of water) and 100\u00b0C (called the steam point of water). Once the liquid levels in the thermometer have been established at these two points, the distance between the two points is divided into 100 equal segments to create the celsius scale. Thus, each segment denotes a change in temperature of one celsius degree (1\u00b0C). A practical problem in this type of thermometer is that readings may vary for two different liquids. When one thermometer reads a temperature, for example 40\u00b0C the other may indicate a slightly different value. This discrepancies between thermometers are especially large at temperatures far from the calibration points. To surmount this problem we need a universal thermometer whose readings are independent of the substance used in it. The gas thermometer used in the next article meets this requirement. 20.2 The Constant Volume Gas Thermometer and The Absolute Temperature Scale The physical property used by the constant volume gas thermometer is the change in pressure of a gas at constant volume. The pressure versus temperature graph for a typical gas taken with a constant volume is shown in figure. The two dots represent the two reference temperatures namely, the ice and steam points of water. The line connecting them serves as a calibration curve for unknown temperatures. Experiments show that the thermometer readings are nearly independent of the type of gas used as long as the gas pressure is low and the temperature is well above the point at which the gas liquefies. 172 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics p 0\u00b0C 100\u00b0C t (\u00b0C) Fig. 20.1  If you extend the curves shown in figure toward negative temperatures, you find, in every case, that the pressure is zero when the temperature is \u2013273.15 C \u00b0 . This significant temperature is used as the basis for the absolute temperature scale, which sets \u2013273.15 C \u00b0 as its zero point. This temperature is often referred to as absolute zero. The size of a degree on the absolute temperature scale is identical to the size of a degree on the celsius scale. Thus, the conversion between these temperatures is T T C = \u2013 273.15 \u2026(i) In 1954, by the International committee on weights and measures, the triple point of water was chosen as the reference temperature for this new scale. The triple point of water is the single combination of temperature and pressure at which liquid water, gaseous water and ice (solid water) coexist in equilibrium. This triple point occurs at a temperature of approximately 0.01 C \u00b0 and a pressure of 4.58 mm of mercury. On the new scale, which uses the unit kelvin, the temperature of water at the triple point was set at 273.16 kelvin, abbreviated as 273.16 K. (No degree sign is used with the unit kelvin). This new absolute temperature scale (also called the kelvin scale) employs the SI unit of absolute temperature, the kelvin which is defined to be \u201c 1 273.16 of the difference between absolute zero and the temperature of the triple point of water\u201d. The Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin Temperature Scales Eq. (i) shows the relation between the temperatures in celsius scales and kelvin scale. Because the size of a degree is the same on the two scales, a temperature difference of 10\u00b0C is equal to a temperature difference of 10 K. The two scales differ only in the choice of the zero point. The ice point temperature on the kelvin scale, 273.15 K, corresponds to 0.00\u00b0C and the kelvin steam point 373.15 K, is equivalent to 100.00\u00b0C. A common temperature scale in everyday use in US is the Fahrenheit scale. The ice point in this scale is 32\u00b0F and the steam point is 212\u00b0F. The distance between these two points are divided in 180 equal parts. The relation between celsius scale and Fahrenheit scale is as derived below.

It is represented by any physical quantity such as length, volume, pressure and resistance etc., which varies linearly with a certain range of temperature. Let X denotes the thermometric physical quantity and X X 0 100 , and Xt be its values at 0\u00b0C, 100\u00b0C and t \u00b0C respectively.

When a body is at a high temperature, it glows brightly and the radiation emitted per second from unit area of the surface of the body is proportional to the fourth power of the absolute temperature of the body. If this radiation is measured by some device, the temperature of the body is calculated. This is the principle of a total radiation pyrometer. The main advantage of this thermometer is that the experimental body is not kept in contact with it. Hence, there is no definite higher limit of its temperature range. It can measure temperature from 800\u00b0C to 3000\u00b0C\u20134000\u00b0C. However, it cannot be used to measure temperatures below 800\u00b0C because at low temperatures the emission of radiation is so poor that it cannot be measured directly. \u0098 Ranges of different thermometers Table 20.1 Thermometer Lower limit Upper limit Mercury thermometer \u201330\u00b0C 300\u00b0C Gas thermometer \u2013268\u00b0C 1500\u00b0C Platinum resistance thermometer \u2013200\u00b0C 1200\u00b0C Thermocouple thermometer \u2013200\u00b0C 1600\u00b0C Radiation thermometer 800\u00b0C No limit \u0098 Reaumur\u2019s scale Other than Celsius, Fahrenheit and Kelvin temperature scales Reaumur\u2019s scale was designed by Reaumur in 1730. The lower fixed point is 0\u00b0R representing melting point of ice. The upper fixed point is 80\u00b0R, which represents boiling point of water. The distance between the two fixed points is divided into 80 equal parts. Each part represents 1\u00b0R.

For each substance, there is a set of temperature and pressure at which all the three states may coexist. This is called triple point of that substance. For water, the values of pressure and temperature corresponding to triple point are 4.58 mm of Hg and 273.16\u00b0K.

Thermal expansion is a consequence of the change in average separation between the constituent atoms of an object. Atoms of an object can be imagined to be connected to one another by stiff springs as shown in Fig. 20.5. At ordinary temperatures, the atoms in a solid oscillate about their equilibrium positions with an amplitude of approximately 10 11 \u2013 m. The average spacing between the atoms is about 10 10 \u2013 m. As the temperature of solid increases, the atoms oscillate with greater amplitudes, as a result the average separation between them increases, consequently the object expands. More precisely, thermal expansion arises from the asymmetrical nature of the potential energy curve. At the atomic level, thermal expansion may be understood by considering how the potential energy of the atoms varies with distance. The equilibrium position of an atom will be at the minimum of the potential energy well if the well is symmetric. At a given temperature, each atom vibrates about its equilibrium position and its average position remains at the minimum point. If the shape of the well is not symmetrical, as shown in figure, the average position of an atom will not be at the minimum point. When the temperature is raised the amplitude of the vibrations increases and the average position is located at a greater interatomic separation. This increased separation is manifested as expansion of the material. Linear Expansion Suppose that the temperature of a thin rod of length l is changed from T to T T + \u2206. It is found experimentally that, if \u2206T is not too large, the corresponding change in length \u2206lof the rod is directly proportional to \u2206T and l. Thus, \u2206 \u2206 l T \u221d and \u2206l l \u221d Introducing a proportionality constant \u03b1 (which is different for different materials) we may write \u2206l as \u2206 \u2206 l l T = \u03b1 \u2026(i) Here, the constant \u03b1 is called the coefficient of linear expansion of the material of the rod and its units are K\u20131 or [( ) ]. \u2013 \u00b0C 1 Remember that \u2206 \u2206 T ",

        "content": "= . Actually, \u03b1 does depend slightly on the temperature, but its variation is usually small enough to be negligible, even over a temperature range of 100\u00b0C. We will always assume that \u03b1 is a constant. Chapter 20 Thermometry, Thermal Expansion and Kinetic Theory of Gases \u0097 177 Fig. 20.5  Volume Expansion Because the linear dimensions of an object change with temperature, it follows that surface area and volume change as well. Just as with linear expansion, experiments show that if the temperature change \u2206T is not too great (less than 100\u00b0C or so), the increase in volume \u2206V is proportional to both, the temperature change \u2206T and the initial volumeV. Thus, \u2206 \u2206 V T \u221d and \u2206V V \u221d Introducing a proportionality constant \u03b3, we may write \u2206V as \u2206 \u2206 V V T = \u00d7 \u00d7 \u03b3 \u2026 (ii) Here, \u03b3 is called the coefficient of volume expansion. The units of \u03b3 are K\u20131 or ( )\u2013 \u00b0C 1. Relation Between \u03b3 and \u03b1 For an isotropic solid (which has the same value of\u03b1 in all directions) \u03b3 \u03b1 = 3 . To see that \u03b3 \u03b1 = 3 for a solid, consider a cube of length l and volumeV l = 3. When the temperature of the cube is increased by dT, the side length increases by dl and the volume increases by an amount dV given by dV dV dl dl l dl = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u22c5 = \u22c5 3 2 Now, dl l dT = \u03b1 \u2234 dV l dT VdT = = 3 3 3\u03b1 \u03b1 ( ) This is consistent with Eq. (ii), dV VdT = \u03b3 , only if \u03b3 \u03b1 = 3 \u2026(iii) Average values of \u03b1 and \u03b3 for some materials are listed in Table 20.2. You can check the relation \u03b3 \u03b1 = 3 , for the materials given in the table.

Their expansion can also be described by Eq. (ii). The volume expansion coefficients for liquids are about 100 times larger than those for solids. Some substances contract when heated over a certain temperature range. The most common example is water. 178 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Figure shows how the volume of 1 g of water varies with temperature at atmospheric pressure. The volume decreases as the temperature is raised from 0\u00b0C to about 4\u00b0C, at 4\u00b0C the volume is a minimum and the density is a maximum (1000 3 kg/m ). Above 4\u00b0C, water expands with increasing temperature like most substances. This anomalous behaviour of water causes ice to form first at the surface of a lake in cold weather. As winter approaches, the water temperature decreases initially at the surface. The water there sinks because of its increased density. Consequently, the surface reaches 0\u00b0C first and the lake becomes covered with ice. Now ice is bad conductor of heat so water at the bottom remains at 4\u00b0C, the highest density of water. Aquatic life is able to survive the cold winter as the bottom of the lake remains unfrozen at a temperature of about 4\u00b0C. \u0098 If a solid object has a hole in it, what happens to the size of the hole, when the temperature of the object increases? A common misconception is that if the object expands, the hole will shrink because material expands into the hole. But the truth is that if the object expands, the hole will expand too, because every linear dimension of an object changes in the same way when the temperature changes. \u0098 Expansion of a bimetallic strip As Table 20.2 indicates, each substance has its own characteristic average coefficient of expansion.

Such type of bimetallic strip is found in practical devices such as thermostats to break or make electrical contact. \u0098 Variation of density with temperature Most substances expand when they are heated, i.e. volume of a given mass of a substance increases on heating, so the density should decrease as \u03c1 \u221d \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 V .Let us see how the density ( ) \u03c1 varies with increase in temperature. \u03c1 = m V or \u03c1 \u221d1 V (for a given mass) \u2234 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03b3 \u03b3 \u2032 = \u2032 = + = + = + V V V V V V V ",

In a gas, the molecules are highly energetic and they can be widely separated from each other. The behaviour of gases and their properties derive from these facts. Sometimes the term vapour is used to describe a gas. Strictly speaking, a gas is a substance at a temperature above its boiling point. A vapour is the gaseous phase of a substance that under ordinary conditions, exists as a liquid or solid. One of the more obvious characteristics of gases is their ability to expand and fill any volume they are placed in. This contrasts with the behaviour exhibited by solids (fixed shape and volume) and liquids (fixed volume but indeterminate shape). Ideal and Real Gas Laws Gases, unlike solids and liquids have indefinite shape and indefinite volume. As a result, they are subjected to pressure changes, volume changes and temperature changes. Real gas behaviour is simpler. By understanding ideal gas behaviour, real gas behaviour becomes more tangible. Chapter 20 Thermometry, Thermal Expansion and Kinetic Theory of Gases \u0097 185 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 20.2  Ideal Gases How do we describe an ideal gas? An ideal gas has the following properties : 1. An ideal gas is considered to be a \"point mass\". A point mass is a particle so small, its volume is very nearly zero. This means an ideal gas particle has virtually no volume. 2. Collisions between ideal gases are \"elastic\". This means that no attractive or repulsive forces are involved during collisions. Also, the kinetic energy of the gas molecules remains constant since these intermolecular forces are lacking. Volume and temperature are by now familiar concepts. Pressure, however, may need some explanation. Pressure is defined as a force per unit area. When gas molecules collide with the sides of a exert, they exert a force over that area of the container. This gives rise to the pressure inside the container. Gas Laws Assuming permanent (or real) gases to be ideal, through experiments, it was established that gases irrespective of their nature obey the following laws : Boyle\u2019s Law According to this law, for a given mass of a gas, the volume of a gas at constant temperature (called isothermal process) is inversely proportional to its pressure, i.e. V p \u221d1 (T = constant) or pV = constant or p V p V i i f f = Thus, p V - graph in an isothermal process is a rectangular hyperbola. Or pV versus p or V graph is a straight line parallel to p or V axis. Charles\u2019 Law According to this law, for a given mass of a gas the volume of a gas at constant pressure (called isobaric process) is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, i.e. 186 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics p V T = constant pV p V or T = constant Fig. 20.12 V T (in K) p = constant V T p T or p = constant Fig. 20.13  V T \u221d (p = constant) or V T = constant or V T V T i i f f = Thus, V-T graph in an isobaric process is a straight line passing through origin. OrV T / versus V or T graph is a straight line parallel to V or T axis. Gay Lussac\u2019s Law or Pressure Law According to this law, for a given mass of a gas the pressure of a gas at constant volume (called isochoric process) is directly proportional to its absolute temperature, i.e. p T \u221d (V = constant) or p T = constant or p T p T i i f f = Thus, p T - graph in an isochoric process is a straight line passing through origin or p T / versus por T graph is a straight line parallel to p or T axis.

For example In Fig. (a), block has one degree of freedom, because it is confined to move in a straight line and has only one translational degree of freedom. In Fig. (b), the particle has two degrees of freedom because it is confined to move in a plane and so it has two translational degrees of freedom. In Fig. (c), the sphere has two degrees of freedom one rotational and another translational. Similarly, a particle free to move in space will have three translational degrees of freedom. Degree of Freedom of Gas Molecules A gas molecule can have, the following types of energies (i) translational kinetic energy (ii) rotational kinetic energy (iii) vibrational energy (potential + kinetic) Vibrational Energy The forces between different atoms of a gas molecule (interatomic force) may be visualized by imagining every atom as being connected to its neighbours by springs. Each atom can vibrate along the line joining the atoms. Energy associated with this is called vibrational energy. Degree of Freedom of Monoatomic Gas A monoatomic gas molecule (like He) consists of a single atom. It can have translational motion in any direction in space. Thus, it has 3 translational degrees of freedom. f = 3 ( ) all translational It can also rotate but due to its small moment of inertia, rotational kinetic energy is neglected.

However, its moment of inertia about the axis joining the two atoms (x-axis) is negligible. Hence, it can have only two rotational degrees of freedom. Thus, a diatomic molecule has 5 degrees of freedom : 3 translational and 2 rotational. At sufficiently high temperatures, it has vibrational energy as well providing it two more degrees of freedom (one vibrational kinetic energy and another vibrational Chapter 20 Thermometry, Thermal Expansion and Kinetic Theory of Gases \u0097 193 f = 1 f = 2 f = 2 Fig. 20.23  potential energy). Thus, at high temperatures a diatomic molecule has 7 degrees of freedom, 3 translational, 2 rotational and 2 vibrational. Thus, f = 5 (3 translational + 2 rotational) at room temperatures and f = 7 (3 translational + 2 rotational + 2 vibrational) at high temperatures. Degree of Freedom of Non-linear Polyatomic Gas A non-linear polyatomic molecule (such as NH3) can rotate about any of three coordinate axes. Hence, it has 6 degrees of freedom 3 translational and 3 rotational. At room temperatures, a polyatomic gas molecule has insignificant vibrational energy. But at high enough temperatures it is also significant. So, it has 8 degrees of freedom 3 rotational, 3 translational and 2 vibrational. Thus, f = 6 (3 translational + 3 rotational) at room temperatures and f = 8 (3 translational + 3 rotational + 2 vibrational) at high temperatures. Degree of Freedom of a Solid An atom in a solid has no degrees of freedom for translational and rotational motion. At high temperatures, due to vibration along 3 axes it has 3 2 6 \u00d7 = degrees of freedom. f = 6 (all vibrational) at high temperatures Note (i) Degrees of freedom of a diatomic and polyatomic gas depends on temperature and since there is no clear cut demarcation line above which vibrational energy become significant. Moreover, this temperature varies from gas to gas. On the other hand, for a monoatomic gas there is no such confusion. Degree of freedom here is 3 at all temperatures. Unless and until stated in the question you can take f = 3 for monoatomic gas, f = 5 for a diatomic gas and f = 6 for a non-linear polyatomic gas. (ii) When a diatomic or polyatomic gas dissociates into atoms it behaves as a monoatomic gas. Whose degrees of freedom are changed accordingly. 194 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics y z x Fig. 20.25 y z x Fig. 20.24  20.7 Internal Energy of an Ideal Gas Suppose a gas is contained in a closed vessel as shown in figure. If the container as a whole is moving with some speed, then this motion is called the ordered motion of the gas. Source of this motion is some external force. The zig-zag motion of gas molecules within the vessel is known as the disordered motion. This motion is directly related to the temperature of the gas. As the temperature is increased, the disordered motion of the gas molecules gets fast. The internal energy (U) of the gas is concerned only with its disordered motion. It is in no way concerned with its ordered motion. When the temperature of the gas is increased, its disordered motion and hence its internal energy is increased. Intermolecular forces in an ideal gas is zero. Thus, PE due to intermolecular forces of an ideal gas is zero. A monoatomic gas is having a single atom. Hence, its vibrational energy is zero. For dia and polyatomic gases vibrational energy is significant only at high temperatures. So, they also have only translational and rotational KE. We may thus conclude that at room temperature the internal energy of an ideal gas (whether it is mono, dia or poly) consists of only translational and rotational KE. Thus, U K K T R ( ) of an ideal gas = + at room temperatures. Later in the next article, we will see that KT (translational KE) and KR (rotational KE) depends on T only. They are directly proportional to the absolute temperature of the gas. Thus, internal energy of an ideal gas depends only on its absolute temperature (T) and is directly proportional to T.

Chapter 20 Thermometry, Thermal Expansion and Kinetic Theory of Gases \u0097 197 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 20.4  20.9 Molar Heat Capacity \u201cMolar heat capacity C is the heat required to raise the temperature of 1 mole of a gas by 1\u00b0C (or 1 K).\u201d Thus, C Q n T = \u2206 \u2206 or \u2206 \u2206 Q nC T = For a gas, the value of C depends on the process through which its temperature is raised. For example, in an isothermal process \u2206T`= 0orCiso = \u221e. In an adiabatic process, (we will discuss it later) \u2206Q = 0.Hence,Cadi = 0. Thus, molar heat capacity of a gas varies from 0 to \u221edepending on the process. In general, experiments are made either at constant volume or at constant pressure. In case of solids and liquids, due to small thermal expansion, the difference in measured values of molar heat capacities is very small and is usually neglected. However, in case of gases molar heat capacity at constant volumeCV is quite different from that at constant pressureC p. Later in the next chapter, we will derive the following relations, (for an ideal gas) C dU dT f R R V = = = 2 1 \u03b3 \u2013 C C R p V = + \u03b3 = = + C C f p V 1 2 Here, U is the internal energy of one mole of the gas.

When we approach the mechanics associated with the many particles in systems such as gases, liquids and solids, we are faced with analyzing the dynamics of a huge number of particles. The dynamics of such many particle systems is called statistical mechanics. The game involved in studying a system with a large number of particles is similar to what happens after every physics test. Of course we are interested in our individual marks, but we also want to know the class average. The kinetic theory that we study in this article is a special aspect of the statistical mechanics of large number of particles. We begin with the simplest model for a monatomic ideal gas, a dilute gas whose particles are single atoms rather than molecules. Macroscopic variables of a gas are pressure, volume and temperature and microscopic properties are speed of gas molecules, momentum of molecules, etc. Kinetic theory of gases relates the microscopic properties to macroscopic properties. Furthermore, the kinetic theory provides us with a physical basis for our understanding of the concept of pressure and temperature. The Ideal Gas Approximation We make the following assumptions while describing an ideal gas : 1. The number of particles in the gas is very large. 2. The volume V containing the gas is much larger than the total volume actually occupied by the gas particles themselves. 3. The dynamics of the particles is governed by Newton\u2019s laws of motion. 4. The particles are equally likely to be moving in any direction. 5. The gas particles interact with each other and with the walls of the container only via elastic collisions. 6. The particles of the gas are identical and indistinguishable. The Pressure of an Ideal Gas Chapter 20 Thermometry, Thermal Expansion and Kinetic Theory of Gases \u0097 201 A cubical box with sides of length containing an ideal gas. The molecule shown moves with velocity . d v d d d z x y vx v m Fig. 20.28  Consider an ideal gas consisting of N molecules in a container of volume V. The container is a cube with edges of length d. Consider the collision of one molecule moving with a velocity v toward the right hand face of the cube. The molecule has velocity components v v x y , and v z .Previously, we used m to represent the mass of a sample, but in this article we shall use m to represent the mass of one molecule. As the molecule collides with the wall elastically its x-component of velocity is reversed, while its y and z- components of velocity remain unaltered. Because the x-component of the momentum of the molecule is mvx before the collision and \u2013mvx after the collision, the change in momentum of the molecule is \u2206p mv mv mv x x x x = = \u2013 \u2013 ( ) \u2013 2 Applying impulse = change in momentum to the molecule F t p mv x x \u2206 \u2206 = = \u2013 2 where, F is the magnitude of the average force exerted by the wall on the molecule in time \u2206t.For the molecules to collide second time with the same wall, it must travel a distance 2d in the x-direction. Therefore, the time interval between two collisions with the same wall is \u2206t d vx = 2 . Over a time interval that is long compared with \u2206t,the average force exerted on the molecules for each collision is F mv t mv d v mv d x x x x = = = \u2013 \u2013 / \u2013 2 2 2 2 \u2206 According to Newton\u2019s third law, the average force exerted by the molecule on the wall is, mv d x 2 . Each molecule of the gas exerts a force on the wall. We find the total force exerted by all the molecules on the wall by adding the forces exerted by the individual molecules. 202 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics A molecule makes an elastic collision with the wall of the container. Its -component of momentum is reversed, while its component remains unchanged. In this construction, we assume that the molecule moves in the - plane. x y- x y vx v vy \u2013vx vy v Fig. 20.29  \u2234 F m d v v v x x xN wall = + +\u2026 + ( ) 1 2 2 2 2 = + + + \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 mN d v v v N x x xN 1 2 2 2 2 K This can also be written as F Nm d vx wall = 2 where, v v v v N x x x xN 2 2 2 2 1 2 = + +\u2026 + Since, the velocity has three components vx, v y and v z , we can have v v v v x y z 2 2 2 2 = + + (as v v v v x y z 2 2 2 2 = + + ) Because the motion is completely random, the average values v v x y 2 2 , and v z 2 are equal to each other. So, v vx 2 2 3 = or v v x 2 2 1 3 = Therefore, F N mv d wall = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7\uf8f7 3 2 \u2234Pressure on the wall p F A F d N d mv = = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 wall wall 2 3 2 1 3 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 3 2 3 1 2 2 2 N V mv N V mv \u2234 p mN V v N V mv = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 3 2 3 1 2 2 2 \u2026(i) This result indicates that the pressure is proportional to the number of molecules per unit volume ( ) ",

Chapter 20 Thermometry, Thermal Expansion and Kinetic Theory of Gases \u0097 209 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 20.5  Final Touch Points 1. Departures from ideal gas behaviour for a real gas An ideal gas is a simple theoretical model of a gas. No real gas is truly ideal. Figure shows departures from ideal gas behaviour for a real gas at three different temperatures. Notice that all curves approach the ideal gas behaviour for low pressures and high temperatures. At low pressures or high temperatures the molecules are far apart and molecular interactions are negligible. Without interactions, the gas behaves like an ideal one . 2. van der Waal\u2019s Equation Experiments have proved that real gases deviate largely from ideal behaviour. The reason of this deviation is two wrong assumptions in the kinetic theory of gases. (i) The size of the molecules is much smaller in comparison to the volume of the gas, hence, it may be neglected. (ii) Molecules do not exert intermolecular force on each other. van der Waal made corrections for these assumptions and gave a new equation. This equation is known as van der Waal\u2019s equation for real gases. (a) Correction for the finite size of molecules: Molecules occupy some volume. Therefore, the volume in which they perform thermal motion is less than the observed volume of the gas. It is represented by ( ) V b \u2212 . Here,b is a constant which depends on the effective size and number of molecules of the gas. Therefore, we should use ( ) V b \u2212 in place ofV in gas equation. (b) Correction for intermolecular attraction: Due to the intermolecular force between gas molecules the molecules which are very near to the wall experiences a net inward force. Due to this inward force there is a decrease in momentum of the particles of a gas. Thus, the pressure exerted by real gas molecules is less than the pressure exerted by the molecules of an ideal gas. So, we use p a V + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 in place of p in gas equation. Here, again a is a constant. van der Waal\u2019s equation of state for real gases thus becomes, p a V V b ",

It seems, therefore, that at low temperatures, rotation is not allowed. At high temperatures, CV starts to rise toward the value 7 2 R . Thus, the vibrational degrees of freedom contribute only at these high temperatures. In Table 20.4 the large values of CV for some polyatomic molecules show the contributions of vibrational energy. In addition, a molecule with three or more atoms that are not in a straight line has three, not two, rotational degrees of freedom. From this discussion, we expect heat capacities to be temperature-dependent, generally increasing with increasing temperature. 5. Solids In crystalline solids (monoatomic), the atoms are arranged in a three dimensional array, called a lattice. Each atom in a lattice can vibrate along three mutually perpendicular directions, each of which has two degrees of freedom. One corresponding to vibrations KE and the other vibrational PE. Thus, each atom has a total of six degrees of freedom. The volume of a solid does not change significantly with temperature, and so there is little difference between CV and Cp for a solid. The molar heat capacity is expected to be C f R R = = 2 6 2 or C R = 3 (ideal monatomic solid) Its numerical value is C \u224825 J /mol -K \u22486 cal/mol -K.

When ordered motion of a gas converts into disordered motion Concept In article 20.7, we have seen that if a container filled with a gas is in motion, then the gas molecules have some ordered motion also. When the container is suddenly stopped, this ordered motion of gas molecules converts into disordered motion. Therefore, internal energy (and hence the temperature) of the gas will increase.

This law can be applied for any type of system like solid, liquid and gas. But, in most of the cases the system will be an ideal gas. A process in which there are changes in the state of a thermodynamic system (like p, V, T, U and \u03c1 etc.) is called a thermodynamic process. We now come to the first law Suppose Q heat is given to a system, then part of it is used by the system in doing work W against the surroundings (like atmosphere) and part is used by the system in increasing its internal energy \u2206U. Thus, Q W U = + \u2206 \u2026(i) Let us take a real life situation similar to first law. Consider a person X .Suppose his monthly income is Rs. 50,000 ( ). Q He spends Rs. 30,000 ( ) W as his monthly expenditure. Then, obviously the remaining Rs. 20,000 goes to his savings ( ). \u2206U In some month it is also possible that he spends more than his income. In that case he will withdraw it from his bank and his savings will get reduced ( ) \u2206U < 0 . In the similar manner, other combinations can be made. Sign Convention (i) Q If heat is given to the system, thenQ is positive and if heat is taken from the system, then it is negative. (ii) W Work done used in Eq. (i) is the work done by the system (not work done on the system). This work done is positive if volume of the system increases. Sign of work done in different situations is given in tabular form as below Table 21.1 S.No Volume of the system Work done by the system used in Eq. (i) Work done on the system 1. is increasing positive negative 2. is decreasing negative positive 3. is constant zero zero (iii) \u2206U Internal energy of a system is due to disordered motion of its constituent particles. It mainly depends on state (solid, liquid and gas) and temperature. For example, two different states at same temperature will have different internal energy. Ice at 0\u00b0C and water at 0\u00b0C have different energies. Similarly, same state at different temperatures will have different energies. For example, internal energy of an ideal gas is given by U nf RT = 2 or U T \u221d If temperature increases, internal energy also increases and \u2206U U U f i = \u2212 will be positive. 238 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  \u0098 If a thermodynamic system changes from an initial equilibrium state A to final equilibrium state Bthrough three different paths 1, 2 and 3, thenQ andW will be different along these three paths. But Q W \u2212 or \u2206U will be same along all three paths. This is because, Q and W are path functions. But U is a state function. Thus, Q W Q W Q W U 1 1 2 2 3 3 \u2212 = \u2212 = \u2212 = \u2206 In a closed path, \u2206U = 0 V Example 21.1 When a system goes from state A to state B, it is supplied with 400 J of heat and it does 100 J of work. (a) For this transition, what is the system\u2019s change in internal energy? (b) If the system moves from B to A, what is the change in internal energy? (c) If in moving from A to B along a different path in which W J AB\u2032 = 400 of work is done on the system, how much heat does it absorb? Solution (a) From the first law, \u2206U Q W ",

At the same time, 73 J of work are done on the system by its surroundings. What is the increase in the internal energy of the system? Chapter 21 Laws of Thermodynamics \u0097 239 A B 3 2 1 Fig. 21.1 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 21.1 Extra Points to Remember  21.2 Further Explanation of Three Terms Used in First Law First law of thermodynamics basically revolves round the three termsQ, \u2206U and W.If you substitute these three terms correctly with proper signs in the equation Q U W = + \u2206 , then you are able to solve most of the problems of first law. Let us take each term one by one. Here, we are taking the system an ideal gas. (i) Heat Transfer (Q or \u2206Q) There are two methods of finding Q or \u2206Q. Method 1. Q nC T = \u2206 or \u2206 \u2206 Q nC T = where, C is the molar heat capacity of the gas and n is the number of moles of the gas. Always take, \u2206T T T f i = \u2013 where, Tf is the final temperature and Ti the initial temperature of the gas. Further, we have discussed in chapter 20, that molar heat capacity of an ideal gas in the process pV x = constant is C R R x C R x V = + = + \u03b3 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 1 1 1 C C R V = = \u03b3 \u20131 in isochoric process and C C C R p V = = + in isobaric process Mostly C p and CV are used. Note For finding C, nature of gas and process should be known. Nature of gas will give us CV and process the value of x. Method 2. We can also find Q by finding \u2206U and W by the equation Q W U = + \u2206 (ii) Change in internal energy ( ) \u2206U There are two methods of finding \u2206U. Method 1. For change in internal energy of the gas \u2206 \u2206 U nC T V = Students are often confused that the result \u2206 \u2206 U nC T V = can be applied only in case of an isochoric process (as CV is here used). However, it is not so. It can be applied in any process, whether it is isobaric, isothermal, adiabatic or else. Note In the above expression, value of CV depends on the nature of gas. Method 2. We can also find \u2206U from the basic equation of first law of thermodynamics, \u2206U Q W = \u2212 (iii) Work done ( ) W This is the most important of the three. 240 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Work Done During Volume Changes A gas in a cylinder with a movable piston is a simple example of a thermodynamic system. Figure shows a gas confined to a cylinder that has a movable piston at one end. If the gas expands against the piston, it exerts a force and does work on the piston. If the piston compresses the gas as it is moved inward, work is done on the gas. The work associated with such volume changes can be determined as follows. Let the gas pressure on the piston face be p. Then, the force on the piston due to the gas is pA, where A is the area of the face. When the piston is pushed outward an infinitesimal distance dx, the work done by the gas is dW Fdx pA dx = = which, since the change in volume of the gas is dV Adx = , becomes dW pdV = For a finite change in volume fromVi toV f , this equation is then integrated between Vi to Vf to find the net work W dW pdV V V i f = = \u222b \u222b Now, there are five methods of finding work done by a gas. Method 1. This is used when p V - equation is known to us. Suppose pas a function of V is known to us. p f V = ( ) then work done can be found by W f V dV V V i f = \u222b ( ) Method 2. The work done by a gas is also equal to the area under p V - graph. Following different cases are possible : Case 1 When volume is constant Chapter 21 Laws of Thermodynamics \u0097 241 dx F pA = Fig. 21.2 p V A B p V B A or Fig. 21.3  V = constant \u2234 WAB = 0 Case 2 When volume is increasing V is increasing \u2234 WAB > 0 WAB = Shaded area Case 3 When volume is decreasing V is decreasing \u2234 WAB < 0 WAB = \u2013 Shaded area Case 4 Cyclic process Wclockwise cycle Shaded area = + [in figure (a)] Wanticlockwise cycle Shaded area = \u2013 [in figure (b)] 242 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics p V A B p V or A B Fig. 21.4 p V A B p V or A B Fig. 21.5 p V p V (a) (b) Fig. 21.6  Case 5 Incomplete cycle WABC = + Shaded area WABCD = \u2013 Shaded area. Method 3. Sometimes work done by the gas is also obtained by finding the forces against which work is done by the gas. For example, in the figure shown, work is done by the gas against the following forces (when the piston is displaced upwards) (i) Against gravity force mg. Since, mg is a constant force. \u2234 W mgx 1 = \u00d7 = Force displacement (ii) Against the force p A 0 . Further, this is also a constant force. \u2234 W p Ax 2 0 = \u00d7 = Force displacement But, Ax V = \u2206 \u2234 W p V 2 0 = \u2206 (iii) Against spring force kx. This is a variable force. Hence, W kx dx kx x 3 2 0 1 2 = = \u222b( ) Note While calculating W3, we have assumed that initially spring is in its natural length. Method 4. In some cases, one process and limits of temperature (or temperature change) is given. In those cases, with the help of given process and the standard ideal gas equation pV nRT = , first we convert pdV into f T dT ( ) and then integrate this expression with the limits of temperature. Thus, W pdV f T dT T T i f = = \u222b \u222b ( ) Chapter 21 Laws of Thermodynamics \u0097 243 p V A B p V A B C C D Fig. 21.7 m, A x k p0 p0 Gas Fig. 21.8  Method 5. The last method of finding work done is from the fundamental equation of first law. or W Q U = \u2212\u2206 Now, let us take example of each one of them. V Example 21.2 Method 1 of Q Temperature of two moles of a monoatomic gas is increased by 300 K in the process p V \u221d . (a) Find molar heat capacity of the gas in the given process. (b) Find heat given to the gas in that. Solution (a) p V \u221d \u21d2 pV \u2212= 1 constant If we compare with pV x = constant, then x = \u22121 Now, C C R x V = + \u2212 1 C R V = 3 2 for a monoatomic gas \u2234 C R R R = + \u2212\u2212 = 3 2 1 1 2 ( ) Ans. (b) Q nC T = \u2206 Substituting the values, we get Q R = ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 2 300 = 1200R Ans. V Example 21.3 Method 2 of Q In a given process work done on a gas is 40 J and increase in its internal energy is 10 J. Find heat given or taken to/from the gas in this process. Solution Given, \u2206U = +10 J Work done on the gas is 40 J. Therefore, work done by the gas used in the equation, Q W U = + \u2206 will be \u221240 J. Now, putting the values in the equation, Q W U = + \u2206 We have, Q = \u2212 + 40 10 = \u221230 J Ans. Here, negative sign indicates that heat is taken out from the gas. V Example 21.4 Method 1 of \u2206U Temperature of two moles of a monoatomic gas is increased by 600 K in a given process. Find change in internal energy of the gas. 244 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Solution Using the equation, \u2206 \u2206 U nC T V = for change in internal energy C R V = 3 2 for monoatomic gas \u2234 \u2206U R = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ( ) ( ) 2 3 2 600 = 1800 R Ans. V Example 21.5 Method 2 of \u2206U Work done by a gas in a given process is \u221220 J. Heat given to the gas is 60 J. Find change in internal energy of the gas. Solution \u2206U Q W = \u2212 Substituting the values we have, \u2206U = \u2212\u2212 60 20 ( ) = 80 J Ans. \u2206U is positive. Hence, internal energy of the gas is increasing.

From the first law, we find that for every adiabatic process, W U = \u2013 \u2206 (as Q = 0) Therefore, if the work done by a gas is positive (i.e. volume of the gas is increasing), then \u2206U will be negative. Hence,U and therefore T will decrease. The cooling of air can be experienced practically during bursting of a tyre. The process is so fast that it can be assumed as adiabatic. As the gas expands. Therefore, it cools. On the other hand, the compression stroke in an internal combustion engine is an approximately adiabatic process. The temperature rises as the air fuel mixture in the cylinder is compressed. Note Contrary to adiabatic process which is very fast an isothermal process is very slow.

For example, Wnet area = + of triangle \u2018abc\u2019 in the shown diagram. Cycle is clockwise. So, work done will be positive. Free expansion in vacuum A gas in a closed adiabatic chamber is taken to vacuum and then chamber is opened. So, the gas expands. Since, there is no external force which opposes this expansion. So, work done by gas W = 0 Further no heat is supplied or taken from the gas. Therefore, heat exchange is also zero. Or Q = 0 From first law of thermodynamics, Q W U = + \u2206 change in internal energy is also zero. Or \u2206U = 0 or U = constant \u21d2 T or pV is also constant or p V \u221d1 This behaviour is similar to an isothermal process. The only difference is, in this process all three terms Q U , \u2206 and W are zero. But in isothermal process, only \u2206U is zero.

In every heat engine, there are the following three components : (i) Working substance (which is normally a gas in a cylinder) (ii) Source (at temperature T1) (iii) Sink (at temperature T2 ),T T 2 1 < and sink is normally atmosphere. The working substance absorbs some heat ( ) Q1 from the source, converts a part of it into work ( ) W and the rest ( ) Q2 is rejected to the sink. From conservation of energy, Q W Q 1 2 = + Now, the above work done is used by us for different purposes. It is just like a shopkeeper. He takes some money from you. (Suppose he takes Rs. 100/- from you). So, you are source. In lieu of this he provides services to you (suppose he provides services of worth Rs. 80/-). This is work done. The remaining Rs. 20/- is his profit which goes to his account and this is basically sink. Then, the efficiency of the shopkeeper is 80%. There can\u2019t be a shopkeeper whose efficiency is 100%. Similarly, efficiency of a heat engine is defined as the ratio of net work done per cycle by the engine to the total amount of heat absorbed per cycle by the working substance from the source. It is denoted by \u03b7. Thus, \u03b7 = = \u2212 = \u2212 W Q Q Q Q Q Q 1 1 2 1 2 1 1 Work is done by the working substance in a cyclic process. In the above expression of efficiency,W is net work done in the complete cycle which should be positive. So, cycle should be clockwise on p V - diagram. Q1 is the total heat given to the working substance or the total positive heat. Q2 is total heat rejected by the working substance or it is the magnitude of total negative heat. Thus, efficiency (\u03b7) of a cycle can also be defined as \u03b7 = Work done by the working substance (an ideal gas in our case) during a cycle Heat supplied to the gas during the cycle \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 \uf8f7 \u00d7100 = \u00d7 W Q Total +ve | | 100 Chapter 21 Laws of Thermodynamics \u0097 257 Sink ",

It is analogous to the transitive property in math (if A C = and B C = , then A B = ). Another way of stating the zeroth law is that every object has a certain temperature, and when two objects are in thermal equilibrium, their temperatures are equal. It is called the zeroth law because it came to light after the first and second laws of thermodynamics had already been established and named, but was considered more fundamental and thus was given a lower number zero. 264 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics B C A D p0 V p ",

        "content": "Fig. 21.28 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 21.4  21.7 Second Law of Thermodynamics The first law of thermodynamics is the principle of conservation of energy. Common experience shows that there are many conceivable processes that are perfectly allowed by the first law and yet are never observed. For example, nobody has ever seen a book lying on a table jumping to a height by itself. But such a thing would be possible if the principle of conservation of energy were the only restriction. Thus, the second law of thermodynamics is a general principle which places constraints upon the direction of and the attainable efficiency of or coefficient of performance. It also imposes restrictions on entropy. Second law of thermodynamics can be better understood by the following three statements In Terms of Entropy The second law can be expressed in several ways, the simplest being that heat will naturally flow from a hotter to a colder body. As its heat is a property of thermodynamic systems called entropy represented by \u201cS\u201d \uf8e7in loose terms, a measure of the amount of disorder within a system. This can be represented in many ways, for example in the arrangement of the molecules \uf8e7water molecules in an ice cube are more ordered than the same molecules after they have been heated into a gas. The entropy of the ice cube is, therefore, lower than that of the gas. Similarly, the entropy of a plate is higher when it is in pieces on the floor compared with when it is in one piece in the sink. The second equation is a way to express the second law of thermodynamics in terms of entropy. The formula says that the entropy of an isolated natural system will always tend to stay the same or increase \uf8e7in other words, the energy in the universe is gradually moving towards disorder. Kelvin Planck\u2019s Statement Kelvin-Planck\u2019s statement is based on the fact that the efficiency of the heat engine cycle is never 100%. This means that in the heat engine cycle some heat is always rejected to the low temperature reservoir. The heat engine cycle always operates between two heat reservoirs and produces work. Clausius Statement As we know from the previous statement, the natural tendency of the heat is to flow from high temperature reservoir to the low temperature reservoir. The Clausius statement says that, to transfer the heat from low temperature to high temperature reservoir some external work should be done on the cycle. This statement has been the basis for the working for all refrigerators, heat pumps and air-conditioners. This work cannot be zero or coefficient of performance of a refrigerator cannot be infinite. Chapter 21 Laws of Thermodynamics \u0097 265  Final Touch Points 1. Adiabatic and Diathermic Wall Adiabatic wall An insulating wall (can be movable also) that does not allow flow of energy (heat) from one chamber to another is called an adiabatic wall. If two thermodynamic systems A andB are separated by an adiabatic wall then the thermodynamic state of A will be independent of the state ofB and vice-versa if wall is fixed otherwise if wall is movable, only pressure will be same on both sides. Diathermic wall A conducting wall that allows energy flow (heat) from one chamber to another is called a diathermic wall. If two thermodynamic systems A and B are separated by a diathermic wall then thermal equilibrium is attained in due course of time (if wall is fixed). If wall is movable, then temperature and pressure on both sides will become same. Note In the above two cases, thermodynamic systems A and B are insulated from the external surroundings. 2. Quasi-Static Process Quasi means almost or near to.Quasi-static process means very nearly static process. Let us consider a system of gas contained in cylinder. The gas is held by a moving piston. A weight w is placed over the piston. Due to the weight , the gas in cylinder is compressed. After the gas reaches equilibrium, the properties of gas are denoted by p V 1 1 , and T1. The weight placed over the piston is balanced by upward force exerted by the gas. If the weight is suddenly removed, then there will be an unbalanced force between the system and the surroundings. The gas under pressure will expand and push the piston upwards. The properties at this state after reaching equilibrium are P V 2 2 , andT2. But the intermediate states passed through, by the system are non-equilibrium states which cannot be described by thermodynamic coordinates. In this case, we only have initial and final states and do not have a path connecting them. 266 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics A B Insulated Gas p V T 1 1 1 , , 1 2 3 4 5 Initial state of gas Gas p V T 2 2 2 , , Final state of gas w Gas Piston p V T 1 1 1 , , Initial state of gas Gas Piston p V T 2 2 2 , , Final state of gas Sudden expansion of gas Quasi-static expansion of gas  Suppose, the weight is made of large numbers of small weights. And one by one each of these small weights are removed and allowed the system to reach an equilibrium state. Then, we have intermediate equilibrium states and the path described by these states will not deviate much from the thermodynamic equilibrium state. Such a process, which is the locus of all the intermediate points passed by the system is known as quasi-static process. It means, this process is almost near to the thermodynamically equilibrium process. Infinite slowness is the characteristic feature of quasi-static process. A quasi-static process is obviously a hypothetical concept. In practice, processes that are sufficiently slow and do not involve accelerated motion of the piston are reasonably approximation to an ideal quasi-static process. We shall from now onwards deal with quasi-static processes only, except when stated otherwise. 3. Reversible and Irreversible Process Reversible process The process in which the system and surroundings can be restored to the initial state from the final state without producing any changes in the thermodynamic properties of the universe is called a reversible process. In the figure below, let us suppose that the system has undergone a change from state A to state B. If the system can be restored from state B to state A, and there is no change in the universe, then the process is said to be a reversible process. The reversible process can be reversed completely and there is no trace left to show that the system had undergone thermodynamic change. For the system to undergo reversible change, it should occur infinitely slowly or it should be quasi-static process. During reversible process, all the changes in state that occur in the system are in thermodynamic equilibrium with each other. Thus, there are two important conditions for the reversible process to occur. Firstly, the process should occur very slowly and secondly all of the initial and final states of the system should be in equilibrium with each other. For example, a quasi-static isothermal expansion of an ideal gas in a cylinder fitted with a frictionless movable piston is a reversible process. In actual practice, the reversible process never occurs, thus it is an ideal or hypothetical process. Irreversible process The process is said to be an irreversible process if it cannot return the system and the surroundings to their original conditions when the process is reversed. The irreversible process is not at equilibrium throughout the process. Several examples can be cited. For examples, (i) When we are driving the car uphill, it consumes a lot of fuel and this fuel is not returned when we are driving down the hill. Chapter 21 Laws of Thermodynamics \u0097 267 x x x x x x 1 2 A quasi-static process A B x y Reversible process  (ii) The base of a vessel on an oven is hotter than its other parts. When the vessel is removed, heat is transferred from the base to the other parts, bringing the vessel to a uniform temperature (which in due course cools to the temperature of the surroundings). The process cannot be reversed; a part of the vessel will not get cooler spontaneously and warm up the base. It will violate the second law of thermodynamics, if it did. (iii) The free expansion of a gas is irreversible. (iv) Cooking gas leaking from a gas cylinder in the kitchen diffuses to the entire room. The diffusion process will not spontaneously reverse and bring the gas back to the cylinder. Many factors contribute in making any process irreversible. The most common of these are: friction, viscosity and other dissipative effects. The irreversible process is also called the natural process because all the processes occurring in nature are irreversible processes. 4.

Let us discuss this topic pointwise. Specific Heat (c) The amount of heat required to raise the temperature of unit mass of a substance by1\u00b0C (or 1 K) is called its specific heat. Thus, c Q m = \u2206\u03b8 or Q m T \u2206 \u2026(i) The SI unit of specific heat is J/kg-K. Because heat is so frequently measured in calories, the unit cal/g-\u00b0C is also used quite often. Heat Required to Change The Temperature From Eq. (i), we can write Q mc = \u2206\u03b8 or mc T \u2206 \u2026(ii) Thus Eq. (ii) is used when temperature of a substance changes without change in state. Note (i) In general c is a function of temperature. But normally variation in c is small. So, it is assumed to be constant for wide range of temperature. For example \u201cSpecific heat of water is 1 cal g C / -\u00b0 between 14.5 \u00b0C to 15.5 \u00b0C\u201d. This implies that 1 cal of heat will be required to raise the temperature of 1 g of water from 14.5 \u00b0C to 15.5 \u00b0C. From 15.5 \u00b0C to 16.5 \u00b0C, a different amount of heat ( ) \u22601 cal will be required. But normally this variation is very small. So, it is assumed constant ( / ) = \u00b0 1 cal g C - from `0 \u00b0C to 100 \u00b0C. (ii) If c is given a function of temperature, then Eq. (ii) cannot be applied directly for calculation of Q. Rather integration will be used. Thus, Q m cdT T T i f = \u222b or m cd i f \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u222b (iii) In the above expression, c is a function of T or ( ) \u03b8 . (iii) The specific heat of water is much larger than that of most other substances. Consequently, for the same amount of added heat, the temperature change of a given mass of water is generally less than that for the same mass of another substance. For this reason a large body of water moderates the climate of nearby land. In the winter, the water cools off more slowly than the surrounding land and tends to warm the land. In the summer, the opposite effect occurs as the water heats up more slowly than the land. (iv) Specific heat is also represented by s or S. So, in different problems we have taken all notations for it. Latent Heat ( ) L The amount of heat required to change the state (or phase) of unit mass of a substance at constant temperature is called latent heat L.Thus, L Q m = \u2026(iv) 308 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Extra Points to Remember For a solid-liquid transition, the latent heat is known as the latent heat of fusion ( ) L f and for the liquid-gas transition, it is known as the latent heat of vaporization ( ) Lv . For water at 1 atmosphere, latent heat of fusion is 80.0 cal/g. This simply means 80.0 cal of heat are required to melt 1.0 g of water or 80.0 cal heat is liberated when 1.0 g of water freezes at 0\u00b0C. Similarly, latent heat of vaporization for water at 1 atmosphere is 539 cal/g. Heat Required to Change the State (or Phase) at Constant Temperature From Eq. (iv), we can see that Q mL = \u2026(v) So, this is the heat required to change the state (or phase) at constant temperature. \u0098 In some problems, two or more than two substances at different temperatures are mixed. Heat is given by the hot bodies and taken by the cold bodies. Finally, all substances reach to a common equilibrium temperature. All such problems can be solved by a single equation, Heat given by hot bodies Heat taken by cold bodies = But note that, on both sides of this equation, we have to take the positive signs. To make them positive, always write \u2206\u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 = \u2212 Higher Lower in the equation Q mc = \u2206\u03b8 when there is a change of temperature without change in state. \u0098 Water equivalent of a container Normally, a liquid is heated in a container. So, some heat is wasted in heating the container also. Suppose water equivalent of a container is 10 g, then it implies that heat required to increase the temperature of this container is equal to heat required to increase the temperature of 10 g of water. V Example 22.1 How much heat is required to convert 8.0 g of ice at \u2013 15\u00b0C to steam at 100\u00b0C? (Given cice , = 0.53 cal/g-\u00b0C, L cal g f = 80 / and Lv = 539 cal/g, and cwater = 1 cal/g-\u00b0C ) Solution Q mc T T f i 1 = ice ( \u2013 ) = = ( ( )[ \u2013 (\u2013 )] 8.0) 0.53 63.6cal 0 15 Q mL f 2 8 80 640 = = = ( ) ( ) cal Q mc T T f i 3 = water ( \u2013 ) = = ( ) ( )[ \u2013 ] 8.0 1.0 cal 100 0 800 Q mLv 4 539 4312 = = = ( ) ( ) 8.0 cal \u2234Net heat required, Q Q Q Q Q = + + + 1 2 3 4 = 5815.6 cal Ans.

In the first two processes, a medium is necessary for the heat transfer. Radiation, however, does no have this restriction. This is also the fastest mode of heat transfer, in which heat is transferred from one place to the other in the form of electromagnetic radiation. Chapter 22 Calorimetry and Heat Transfer \u0097 313 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 22.1  Conduction Figure shows a rod whose ends are in thermal contact with a hot reservoir at temperature T1 and a cold reservoir at temperature T2. The sides of the rod are covered with insulating medium, so the transport of heat is along the rod, not through the sides. The molecules at the hot reservoir have greater vibrational energy. This energy is transferred by collisions to the atoms at the end face of the rod. These atoms in turn transfer energy to their neighbours further along the rod. Such transfer of heat through a substance in which heat is transported without direct mass transport is called conduction. Most metals use another, more effective mechanism to conduct heat. The free electrons, which move throughout the metal can rapidly carry energy from the hotter to cooler regions, so metals are generally good conductors of heat. The presence of \u2018free\u2019 electrons also causes most metals to be good electrical conductors. A metal rod at 5\u00b0C feels colder than a piece of wood at 5\u00b0C because heat can flow more easily from your hand into the metal. Heat transfer occurs only between regions that are at different temperatures, and the rate of heat flow is dQ dt .This rate is also called the heat current, denoted by H. Experiments show that the heat current is proportional to the cross-section area A of the rod and to the temperature gradient dT dx , which is the rate of change of temperature with distance along the bar. In general, H dQ dt KA dT dx = = \u2013 \u2026(i) The negative sign is used to make dQ dt a positive quantity since dT dx is negative. The constant K, called the thermal conductivity is a measure of the ability of a material to conduct heat. A substance with a large thermal conductivity k is a good heat conductor. The value of k depends on the temperature, increasing slightly with increasing temperature, but K can be taken to be practically constant throughout a substance if the temperature difference between its ends is not too great. Let us apply Eq. (i) to a rod of length l and constant cross-sectional area A in which a steady state has been reached. In a steady state, the temperature at each point is constant in time. Hence, \u2013 \u2013 dT dx T T = 1 2 Therefore, the heat \u2206Q transferred in time \u2206t is \u2206 \u2206 Q ",

In this process, the actual motion of the material is responsible for the heat transfer. Familiar examples include hot-air and hot-water home heating systems, the cooling system of an automobile engine and the flow of blood in the body. You probably have warmed your hands by holding them over an open flame. In this situation, the air directly above the flame is heated and expands. As a result, the density of this air decreases and then air rises. When the movement results from differences in density, as with air around fire, it is referred to as natural convection. Air flow at a beach is an example of natural convection. When the heated substance is forced to move by a fan or pump, the process is called forced convection. If it were not for convection currents, it would be very difficult to boil water. As water is heated in a kettle, the heated water expands and rises to the top because its density is lowered. At the same time, the denser, cool water at the surface sinks to the bottom of the kettle and is heated. Heating a room by a radiator is an example of forced convection. Radiation The third means of energy transfer is radiation which does not require a medium. The best known example of this process is the radiation from sun. All objects radiate energy continuously in the form of electromagnetic waves. Now, let us define few terms before studying the other topics. Radiant Energy All bodies radiate energy in the form of electromagnetic waves by virtue of their temperature. This energy is called the radiant energy. Absorptive Power \u2018a\u2019 \u201cIt is defined as the ratio of the radiant energy absorbed by it in a given time to the total radiant energy incident on it in the same interval of time.\u201d a = energy absorbed energy incident As a perfectly black body absorbs all radiations incident on it, the absorptive power of a perfectly black body is maximum and unity. Spectral Absorptive Power \u2018a \u03bb \u2019 The absorptive power \u2018a\u2019 refers to radiations of all wavelengths (or the total energy) while the spectral absorptive power is the ratio of radiant energy absorbed by a surface to the radiant energy incident on it for a particular wavelength \u03bb. It may have different values for different wavelengths for a given surface. Let us take an example, suppose a = 0.6, a\u03bb = 0.4 for1000 \u00c5and a\u03bb = 0.7 for 2000 \u00c5 for a given surface. Then, it means that this surface will absorb only 60% of the total radiant energy incident on it. Similarly, it absorbs 40% of the energy incident on it corresponding to1000 \u00c5and 70% corresponding to 2000 \u00c5.The spectral absorptive power a\u03bb is related to absorptive power a through the relation a a d = \u221e\u222b \u03bb \u03bb 0 316 \u0097 Waves and Thermodynamics  Emissive Power \u2018e\u2019 (Do not confuse it with the emissivity e which is different from it, although both have the same symbol e). \u201cFor a given surface it is defined as the radiant energy emitted per second per unit area of the surface.\u201d It has the units of W/m 2 or J/s-m 2.For a black body e T = \u03c3 4. Spectral Emissive Power \u2018e \u03bb \u2019 \u201cIt is emissive power for a particular wavelength \u03bb.\u201d Thus, e e d = \u221e\u222b \u03bb \u03bb 0 Stefan\u2019s Law The rate at which an object radiates energy is proportional to the fourth power of its absolute temperature. This is known as the Stefan\u2019s law and is expressed in equation form as P AeT = \u03c3 4 Here, P is the power in watts (J/s) radiated by the object, A is the surface area in m 2, e is a fraction between 0 and 1 called the emissivity of the object and \u03c3 is a universal constant called Stefan\u2019s constant, which has the value \u03c3 = \u00d7 5.67 10 W/m -K \u20138 2 4 Note Emissivity e is also sometimes denoted by er. Perfectly Black Body A body that absorbs all the radiation incident upon it and has an emissivity equal to 1 is called a perfectly black body. A black body is also an ideal radiator. It implies that if a black body and an identical another body are kept at the same temperature, then the black body will radiate maximum power as is obvious from equation P eA T = \u03c3 4 also. Because e =1for a perfectly black body while for any other body e <1. Materials like black velvet or lamp black come close to being ideal black bodies, but the best practical realization of an ideal black body is a small hole leading into a cavity, as this absorbs 98% of the radiation incident on them. Note (i) Energy radiated by a body per unit area per unit time is called emissive power and given by e e T r = \u03c3 4 ( ) e emissivity r = Chapter 22 Calorimetry and Heat Transfer \u0097 317 Cavity approximating an ideal black body.

Further, er = 0.6 means if this body and perfectly black body are kept under identical conditions then this body will radiate 60% of the energy radiated by a perfectly black body.

Cooling by Radiation Consider a hot body at temperature T placed in an environment at a lower temperature T0.The body emits more radiation than it absorbs and cools down while the surroundings absorb radiation from the body and warm up. The body is losing energy by emitting radiations at a rate P eA T 1 4 = \u03c3 and is receiving energy by absorbing radiations at a rate P aA T 2 0 4 = \u03c3 Here, \u2018a\u2019 is a pure number between 0 and 1 indicating the relative ability of the surface to absorb radiation from its surroundings. Note that this \u2018a\u2019 is different from the absorptive power \u2018a\u2019. In thermal equilibrium, both the body and the surroundings have the same temperature (say Tc) and, P P 1 2 = or eA T aA T c c \u03c3 \u03c3 4 4 = or e a = Thus, when T T > 0, the net rate of heat transfer from the body to the surroundings is dQ dt eA T T = \u03c3 ( \u2013 ) 4 0 4 or mc dT dt eA T T \u2013 ( \u2013 ) \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= \u03c3 4 0 4 Rate of cooling \u2013 ( \u2013 ) dT dt eA mc T T \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= \u03c3 4 0 4 or \u2013 ( \u2013 ) dT dt T T \u221d 4 0 4 Newton\u2019s Law of Cooling According to this law, if the temperature T of the body is not very different from that of the surroundings T0, then rate of cooling \u2013 dT dt is proportional to the temperature difference between them.

Figure shows how the energy of a black body radiation varies with temperature and wavelength. As the temperature of the black body increases, two distinct behaviors are observed. The first effect is that the peak of the distribution shifts to shorter wavelengths. This shift is found to obey the following relationship called Wien\u2019s displacement law. \u03bb mT b = Here, b is a constant called Wien\u2019s constant. The value of this constant for perfectly black body in SI unit is 2.898 10 m-K. \u20133 \u00d7 Thus, \u03bb m T \u221d1 Here, \u03bb m is the wavelength corresponding to the maximum spectral emissive power e\u03bb . The second effect is that the total amount of energy the black body emits per unit area per unit time ( ) = \u03c3T 4 increases with fourth power of absolute temperature T. This is also known as the emissive power. We know e e d = = \u221e\u222b \u03bb \u03bb 0 Area under e\u03bb \u03bb - graph = \u03c3T 4 or Area \u221dT 4 \u21d2 A A A 2 4 1 1 2 16 = = ( ) Thus, if the temperature of the black body is made two fold, \u03bb m remains half while the area becomes 16 times.

If f is doubled (which is source dependant), then \u03bb will automatically become half, so that speed remains same. Because speed is only medium dependant. 5. Longitudinal or sound wave cannot travel in vacuum. 7. Electromagnetic wave which can travel with or without medium. 8. Just by observation we cannot say that \u00b5 \u00b5 2 1 > and hence v v 2 1 > . If their densities are different, then \u00b52 may be less than \u00b51 also. 9. At mean position kinetic energy is maximum and there is a maximum stretch in string. Because one side particles are moving up and the other side particles are moving down. Hence, potential energy is also maximum. 10. In v v y x P = \u2212 \u2202 \u2202, vP is negative and \u2202 \u2202 y x (the slope) is also negative. Hence, the velocity v should also be negative.

(b) The expressions for reflected and transmitted amplitudes (Ar and At) in terms of v v 1 2 , and Ai are as follows : A v v v v A r i = \u2212 + 2 1 2 1 and A v v v A t i = + 2 2 1 2 Substituting the values, we get Ar = \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \u2212 32 80 32 80 (3.5) 1.5 cm i.e. the amplitude of  reflected wave will be 1.5 cm. Negative sign of Ar indicates that there will be a phase change of \u03c0 in reflected wave. Similarly, At = \u00d7 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = 2 32 32 80 (3.5) 2.0 cm i.e. the amplitude of transmitted wave will be 2.0 cm. The expressions of Ar and At are derived as below. Derivation Suppose the incident wave of amplitude Ai and angular frequency \u03c9 is travelling in positive x-direction with velocity v1, then we can write y A t x v i i = \u2212 sin [ / ] \u03c9 1 \u2026(i) In reflected as well as transmitted wave, \u03c9 will not change, therefore, we can write y A t x v r r = + sin [ / ] \u03c9 1 \u2026(ii) and y A t x v t t = \u2212 sin [ / ] \u03c9 2 \u2026(iii) Now as wave is continuous, so at the boundary ( ). x = 0 Continuity of displacement requires y y y i r i + = for x = 0 Substituting from Eqs. (i), (ii) and (iii) in the above, we get A A A i r t + = \u2026(iv) Also at the boundary, slope of wave will be continuous, i.e. \u2202 + \u2202 = \u2202 \u2202 y x y x y x i r t \u03b4 \u03b4 [ ] for x = 0 which gives A A v v A i r t \u2212 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 2 \u2026(v) Solving Eqs. (iv) and (v) for Ar and At, we get the required equations, i.e. A v v v v A r i = \u2212 + 2 1 2 1 and A = A t i 2 2 2 1 v v v + 6.

Hence, n1 2 80 \u03bb = or n1 160 \u03bb = \u2026(i) Between P and R, P is a fixed end and R is the free end. It means the number of loops between P and R will be odd multiple of \u03bb 4.

Temperature of the gas is associated with random or disordered motion of the gas molecules. By the motion of container total kinetic energy of gas molecules will increase. But temperature will not increase. 5. Internal energy is equally distributed in all degrees of freedom. For example K K T R = 3 2 in diatomic gas As fT = 3 and fR = 2 7.
