The active elements such as a battery or a cell, supply electric energy to the circuit. On the contrary, passive elements consume or store the electric energy. The basic passive elements are resistor, capacitor and inductor. A resistor opposes the flow of current through it and if some current is passed by maintaining a potential difference across it, some energy is dissipated in the form of heat. A capacitor is a device which stores energy in the form of electric potential energy. It opposes the variations in voltage. An inductor opposes the variations in current. It does not oppose the steady current through it. Fundamentally, electric circuits are a means for conveying energy from one place to another. As charged particles move within a circuit, electric potential energy is transferred from a source (such as a battery or a cell) to a device in which that energy is either stored or converted to another form, like sound in a stereo system or heat and light in a toaster or light bulb. Electric circuits are useful because they allow energy to be transported without any moving parts (other than the moving charged particles themselves). In this chapter, we will study the basic properties of electric currents. We\u2019ll study the properties of batteries and how they cause current and energy transfer in a circuit. In this analysis, we will use the concepts of current, potential difference, resistance and electromotive force. 23.2 Electric Current Flow of charge is called electric current. The direction of electric current is in the direction of flow of positive charge or in the opposite direction of flow of negative charge. Current is defined quantitatively in terms of the rate at which net charge passes through a cross-section area of the conductor. Thus, I dq dt = or i dq dt = We can have the following two concepts of current, as in the case of velocity, instantaneous current and average current. Instantaneous current = = dq dt current at any point of time and Average current = q t Hence-forth unless otherwise referred to, current would signify instantaneous current. By convention, the direction of the current is assumed to be that in which positive charge moves. In the SI system, the unit of current is ampere (A). 1 1 A C/s = Household currents are of the order of few amperes. Flow of Charge If current is passing through a wire then it implies that a charge is flowing through that wire. Further, i dq dt = \u21d2 dq idt = \u2026(i) 2 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism  Now, three cases are possible : Case 1 If given current is constant, then from Eq. (i) we can see that flow of charge can be obtained directly by multiplying that constant current with the given time interval. Or, \u2206 \u2206 q i t = \u00d7 Case 2 If given current is a function of time, then charge flow can be obtained by integration. Or, \u2206q i dt t t i f = \u222b Case 3 If current versus time is given, then flow of charge can be obtained by the area under the graph. \u2206q i t = area under - graph \u0098 The current is the same for all cross-sections of a conductor of non-uniform cross-section. Similar to the water flow, charge flows faster where the conductor is smaller in cross-section and slower where the conductor is larger in cross-section, so that charge rate remains unchanged. \u0098 Electric current is very similar to water current, consider a water tank kept at some height and a pipe is connected to the water tank. The rate of flow of water through the pipe depends on the height of the tank. As the level of water in the tank falls, the rate of flow of water through the pipe also gets reduced. Just as the flow of water depends on the height of the tank or the level of water in the tank, the flow of current through a wire depends on the potential difference between the end points of the wire. As the potential difference is changed, the current will change. For example, during the discharging of a capacitor potential difference and hence, the current in the circuit decreases with time. To maintain a constant current in a circuit a constant potential difference will have to be maintained and for this a battery is used which maintains a constant potential difference in a circuit. \u0098 Though conventionally a direction is associated with current (opposite to the motion of electrons), it is not a vector as the direction merely represents the sense of charge flow and not a true direction. Further, current does not obey the law of parallelogram of vectors, i.e. if two currents i1 and i 2 reach a point we always have i i i = + 1 2 whatever be the angle between i1 and i 2. \u0098 According to its magnitude and direction, current is usually divided into two types : (i) Direct current (DC) If the magnitude and direction of current does not vary with time, it is said to be direct current (DC). Cell, battery or DC dynamo are its sources. (ii) Alternating current (AC) If a current is periodic (with constant amplitude) and has half cycle positive and half negative, it is said to be alternating current (AC). AC dynamo is the source of it. \u0098 If a charge q revolves in a circle with frequency f, the equivalent current, i q f = \u0098 In a conductor, normally current flow or charge flow is due to flow of free electrons. \u0098 Charge is quantised. The quantum of charge ise. The charge on any body will be some integral multiple of e, i.e. q ne = \u00b1 where, n = 1 2 3 , , K Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 3 Extra Points to Remember \u03b8 i1 i2 i i i = + 1 2 Fig. 23.1  V Example 23.1 In a given time of 10 s, 40 electrons pass from right to left. In the same interval of time 40 protons also pass from left to right. Is the average current zero? If not, then find the value of average current. Solution No, the average current is not zero. Direction of current is the direction of motion of positive charge or in the opposite direction of motion of negative charge. So, both currents are from left to right and both currents will be added. \u2234 I I I av electron proton = + = + q t q t 1 1 2 2 = + 40 10 40 10 e e ( ) q ne = = 8 e = \u00d7 \u00d7 \u2212 8 10 19 1.6 A = \u00d7 \u2212 1.28 A 10 18 Ans.

Is there a net current? If yes, in what direction? Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 5 t s ( ) i A ( ) 10 4 Fig. 23.2 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 23.1  23.3 Electric Currents in Conductors Conductors are those materials which can conduct electricity. Conductors can be broadly classified into two groups : (i) Solid conductors (ii) Electrolyte conductors Normally in atoms and molecules, the negatively charged electrons and the positively charged nuclei are bound to each other and are thus not free to move. In solid conductors (notably metals), some of the electrons (called free electrons) are free to move within the bulk materials. In these conductors, current flow takes place due to these free electrons. Positive ions in these conductors are almost fixed. They do not move. So, they do not contribute in the current. In electrolyte solutions however, both positive and negative ions can move. In our following discussions, we will focus only on solid conductors so that the current is carried by the negatively charged free electrons in the background of fixed positive ions. Theory of Current Flow through Solid Conductors At room temperature, the free electrons in a conductor move randomly with speeds of the order of 105 m/s.Since, the motion of the electrons is random, there is no net charge flow in any direction. For any imaginary plane passing through the conductor, the number of electrons crossing the plane in one direction is equal to the number crossing it in the other direction. Therefore, net current is zero from any section. When a constant potential difference V is applied between the ends of the conductor as shown in Fig. 23.4, an electric field E is produced inside the conductor. The conduction electrons within the conductor are then subjected to a force \u2013 eEand move overall in the direction of increasing potential. However, this force does not cause the electrons to move faster and faster. Instead, a conduction electron accelerates through a very small distance (about 5 10 8 \u00d7 \u2212m) and then collides with fixed ions or atoms of the conductor. Each collision transfers some of the electron\u2019s kinetic energy to the ions (or atoms). Because of the collision, electron moves slowly along the conductor or we can say that it acquires a drift velocity vd in the direction opposite to E (in addition to its random motion.) The drift motion of free electrons produce an electric current in the opposite direction of this motion or in the direction of electric field (from higher potential to lower potential). It is interesting to note 6 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Fig. 23.3 V + \u2013 E V i + vd \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Fig. 23.4  that the magnitude of the drift velocity is of the order of 10 4 \u2013 m/s or about 109 times smaller than the average speed of the electrons of their random (or thermal) motion. The above discussion can be summarized as follows : 1. Free electrons inside a solid conductor can have two motions : (i) random or thermal motion (speed of the order of 105 m/s) (ii) drift motion (speed of the order of10 4 \u2013 m/s) 2. Net current due to random (or thermal motion) is zero from any section, whereas net current due to drift motion is non-zero. 3. In the absence of any electric field (or a potential difference across the conductor) free electrons have only random motion. Hence, net current from any section is zero. 4. In the presence of an electric field (or a potential difference across the conductor) free electrons have both motions (random and drift). Therefore, current is non-zero due to drift motion. 5. Drift motion of free electrons is opposite to the electric field. Therefore, direction of current is in the direction of electric field from higher potential to lower potential. V Example 23.6 Electric field inside a conductor is always zero. Is this statement true or false? Solution False. Under electrostatic conditions when there is no charge flow (or no current) in the conductor, electric field is zero. If current is non-zero, then electric field is also non-zero. Because the drift motion (of free electrons) which produces a net current starts only due to electric force on them. 1. All points of a conductor are always at same potential. Is this statement true or false? 23.4 Drift Velocity and Relaxation Time As discussed before, in the presence of electric field, the free electrons experience an electric force of magnitude. F qE = or eE (as q e = ) This will produce an acceleration of magnitude, a F m eE m = = ( ) m = mass of electron Direction of force (and acceleration) is opposite to the direction of electric field. After accelerating to some distance an electron will suffer collisions with the heavy fixed ions. The collisions of the electrons do not occur at regular intervals but at random times. Relaxation time\u03c4 is the average time between two successive collisions. Its value is of the order of 10 14 \u2212 second. After every collision, let us assume that drift motion velocity of electron becomes zero. Then, it accelerates for a time interval \u03c4, then again it collides and its drift motion velocity becomes zero and so on. Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 7 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 23.2  Extra Points to Remember If vd is the average constant velocity (called drift velocity) in the direction of drift motion, then relation between vd and \u03c4 is given by v eE m d = \u03c4 \u0098 In some standard books of Indian authors, the relation is given as v eE 2m d = \u03c4 Initially, I was also convinced with this expression. But later on after consulting many more literatures in this. I found that v eE m d = \u03c4 is correct. But at this stage it is very difficult for me to give its correct proof. Because the correct proof requires a knowledge of high level of physics which is difficult to understand for a class XII student. Current and Drift Velocity Consider a cylindrical conductor of cross-sectional area A in which an electric field E exists. Drift velocity of free electrons is vd and n is number of free electrons per unit volume (called free electron density). Consider a length v t d \u2206of the conductor. The volume of this portion is Av t d \u2206. Number of free electrons in this volume = (free electron density ) \u00d7 (volume) = ( ) ( ) n Av t d \u2206 = nAv t d \u2206 All these electrons cross the area A in time \u2206t. Thus, the charge crossing this area in time \u2206t is \u2234 \u2206 \u2206 q nAv t e d = ( ) ( ) or i q t neAvd = = \u2206 \u2206 or i neAvd = Thus, this is the relation between current and drift velocity. 8 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism i E v t d \u2206 vd Fig. 23.5  Current Density Current per unit area (taken normal to the current), i A / is called current density and is denoted by j. The SI units of current density are A/m 2.Current density is a vector quantity jdirected along E. j i A = But i neAvd = , therefore j nevd = \u0098 Drift velocity of electrons in a conductor is of the order of 10 4 \u2212m/s, then question arises in everybody\u2019s mind that why a bulb glows instantly when switched on? Reason is : when we close the circuit, electric field is set up in the entire closed circuit instantly (with the speed of light). Due to this electric field, the free electrons instantly get drift velocity in the entire circuit and a current is established in the circuit instantly. The current so set up does not wait for the electrons to flow from one end of the conductor to the other end. \u0098 If a current i is flowing through a wire of non-uniform cross-section, then current will remain constant at all cross-sections. But drift velocity and current density are inversely proportional to the area of cross-section. This is because i neAvd = or v i neA d = or v A d \u221d1 Further, j i A = or j A \u221d1 So, in the figure i i i 1 2 = = but, ( ) ( ) v v d d 2 1 > and j j 2 1 > because A A 2 1 < Note Later we can also prove that electric field at 2 is also more than electric field at 1 .

Find (a) the current and (b) the current density in the beam.

When a wire carries a current of 1.20 A, the drift velocity is 1.20 m/s \u00d7 \u2212 10 4 . What is the drift velocity when the current is 6.00 A? 2. Find the velocity of charge leading to 1 A current which flows in a copper conductor of cross-section 1 2 cm and length 10 km. Free electron density of copper is 8.5 m \u00d7 1028 3 / . How long will it take the electric charge to travel from one end of the conductor to the other? 23.5 Resistance of a Wire Resistance of a wire is always required between two points or two surfaces (say P and Q). Here, l = length of wire, A = area of cross-section Now, R l \u221d \u2026(i) and R A \u221d1 \u2026(ii) Combining Eqs. (i) and (ii), we get R l A = \u03c1 \u2026(iii) 10 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 23.3 Q P l A Fig. 23.7  Here, \u03c1 is called resistivity of the material of the wire. This depends on number of free electrons present in the material. With increase in number of free electrons the value of \u03c1 decreases. Note (i) \u03c1 \u03c3 = 1 , where \u03c3 = conductivity. (ii) SI units of resistivity are \u2126-m (ohm-metre). (iii) SI units of conductivity are ( ) \u2126-m \u22121. (iv) In Eq. (iii),l is that dimension of conductor which is parallel to P and Q and A is that cross-sectional area, which is perpendicular to P and Q. V Example 23.9 Two copper wires of the same length have got different diameters, (a) which wire has greater resistance? (b) greater specific resistance? Solution (a) For a given wire, R l A = \u03c1 , i.e. R A \u221d1 So, the thinner wire will have greater resistance. (b) Specific resistance ( ) \u03c1 is a material property. It does not depend on l or A. So, both the wires will have same specific resistance. V Example 23.10 A wire has a resistance R. What will be its resistance if it is stretched to double its length? Solution Let V be the volume of wire, then V Al = \u2234 A V l = Substituting this in R l A = \u03c1 , we have R l V = \u03c1 2 So, for given volume and material (i.e.V and \u03c1 are constants) R l \u221d 2 When l is doubled, resistance will become four times, or the new resistance will be 4R.

Due to this effect conductivity of the material increases. So, resistivity or resistance decreases. (ii) The ions of the material vibrate with greater amplitude and the collision between electrons and ions become more frequent. Due to this effect resistivity or resistance of the material increases. In Conductors There are already a large number of free electrons. So, with increase in temperature effect-(i) is not so dominant as effect-(ii). Hence, resistivity or resistance of conductors increase with increase in temperature. Over a small temperature range (upto 100\u00b0C), the resistivity of a metal (or conductors) can be represented approximately by the equation, \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03b1 ( ) [ ( \u2013 )] T T T = + 0 0 1 \u2026(i) where, \u03c10 is the resistivity at a reference temperatureT0 (often taken as 0\u00b0C or 20\u00b0C) and \u03c1 ( ) T is the resistivity at temperature T, which may be higher or lower than T0. The factor \u03b1 is called the temperature coefficient of resistivity. The resistance of a given conductor depends on its length and area of cross-section besides the resistivity. As temperature changes, the length and area also change. But these changes are quite small and the factor l A / may be treated as constant. Then, R \u221d\u03c1 and hence, ",

Suppose we want to recycle water between a overhead tank and a ground water tank. Water flows from overhead tank to ground water tank by itself (by gravity). No external agent is required for this purpose. But to raise the water from ground water tank to overhead tank a pump is required or some external work has to be done. In an electric circuit, a battery or a cell plays the same role as the pump played in the above example. Suppose a resistance (R) is connected across the terminals of a battery. A potential difference is developed across its ends. Current (or positive charge) flows from higher potential to lower potential across the resistance by itself. But inside the battery, work has to be done to bring the positive charge from lower potential to higher potential. The influence that makes current flow from lower to higher potential (inside the battery) is called electromotive force (abbreviated emf). If W work is done by the battery in taking a charge q from negative terminal to positive terminal, then work done by the battery per unit charge is called emf (E) of the battery. Thus, E W q = The name electromotive force is misleading in the sense that emf is not a force it is work done per unit charge. The SI unit of emf is J/C or V (1V 1 J/C = ). 23.9 Direct Current Circuits, Kirchhoff\u2019s Laws Single current in a simple circuit (single loop) can be found by the relation, 16 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism Overhead tank Ground water tank Pump Fig. 23.13 H L R H L Fig. 23.14 6V i 6V i 10V i E (a) (b) (c) 3\u2126 2\u2126 R Fig. 23.15  i E R = = net emf net resistance net net For example : In Fig. (a) Net emf is 6 V and net resistance is 3 \u2126.

Of these polarity of m cells (where n m > 2 ) is reversed. Then, net emf in the circuit is ( \u2013 ) n m E 2 and resistance of the circuit is R. Therefore, i n m E R = ( \u2013 ) 2 Resistors in Series and in Parallel In series : Figure represents a circuit consisting of a source of emf and two resistors connected in series. We are interested in finding the resistance R of the network lying between A and B. That is, what single equivalent resistor R would have the same resistance as the two resistors linked together. Because there is only one path for electric current to follow, i must have the same value everywhere in the circuit. The potential difference between A and B is V. This potential difference must somehow be divided into two partsV1 andV2 as shown, \u2234 V V V = + 1 2 = + iR iR 1 2 or V i R R = + ( ) 1 2 \u2026(i) Let R be the equivalent resistance between A and B, then V iR = \u2026(ii) From Eqs.

However, it is always possible to analyze such circuits by applying two rules, devised by Kirchhoff in 1845 and 1846 when he was still a student. First there are two terms that we will use often. Junction A junction in a circuit is a point where three or more conductors meet. Junctions are also called nodes or branch points. For example, in Fig. (a) points D and C are junctions. Similarly, in Fig. (b) points B and F are junctions. Loop A loop is any closed conducting path. For example, in Fig. (a) ABCDA, DCEFD and ABEFA are loops. Similarly, in Fig. (b), CBFEC, BDGFB are loops. Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 19 i 6\u2126 18V Fig. 23.20 A C D E F B ",

        "content": "Fig. 23.21  Kirchhoff\u2019s rules consist of the following two statements : Kirchhoff\u2019s Junction Rule The algebraic sum of the currents into any junction is zero. That is, junction \u03a3 i =0 This law can also be written as, \u201cthe sum of all the currents directed towards a point in a circuit is equal to the sum of all the currents directed away from that point.\u201d Thus, in figure i i i i 1 2 3 4 + = + The junction rule is based on conservation of electric charge. No charge can accumulate at a junction, so the total charge entering the junction per unit time must equal to charge leaving per unit time. Charge per unit time is current, so if we consider the currents entering to be positive and those leaving to be negative, the algebraic sum of currents into a junction must be zero. Kirchhoff\u2019s Loop Rule The algebraic sum of the potential differences in any loop including those associated emf\u2019s and those of resistive elements, must equal zero. That is, closed loop \u03a3 \u2206V = 0 Kirchhoff\u2019s second rule is based on the fact that the electrostatic field is conservative in nature. This result states that there is no net change in electric potential around a closed path. Kirchhoff\u2019s second rule applies only for circuits in which an electric potential is defined at each point. This criterion may not be satisfied if changing electromagnetic fields are present. In applying the loop rule, we need sign conventions. First assume a direction for the current in each branch of the circuit. Then starting at any point in the circuit, we imagine, travelling around a loop, adding emf\u2019s and iR terms as we come to them. When we travel through a source in the direction from \u2013 to +, the emf is considered to be positive, when we travel from + to \u2013, the emf is considered to be negative. When we travel through a resistor in the same direction as the assumed current, the iR term is negative because the current goes in the direction of decreasing potential. When we travel through a resistor in the direction opposite to the assumed current, the iR term is positive because this represents a rise of potential. 20 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism i1 i2 i3 i4 Fig. 23.22 A B E Path \u2206V V V E = \u2013 = + B A A B E Path \u2206V V V E = \u2013 = \u2013 B A Fig. 23.23 Path \u2206V V V iR = \u2013 = \u2013 B A A B R R i Path \u2206V V V iR = \u2013 = + B A A B i Fig. 23.24  Note It is advised to write H (for higher potential) and L (for lower potential) across all the batteries and resistances of the loop under consideration while using the loop law. Then write \u2013 while moving from H to L and + for L to H. Across a battery write H on positive terminal and L on negative terminal. Across a resistance keep in mind the fact that current always flows from higher potential (H) to lower potential (L). For example, in the loop shown in figure we have marked H and L across all batteries and resistances. Now let us apply the second law in the loop ADCBA.

HOW TO PROCEED To find the po ten tial dif fer ence be tween any two points of a cir cuit you have to reach from one point to the other via any path of the cir cuit. It is ad vis able to choose a path in which we come across the least num ber of re sis tors pref er a bly a path which has no re sis tance.

Here, negative sign implies that V V F C < . Internal Resistance (r ) and Potential Difference (V ) across the Terminals of a Battery The potential difference across a real source in a circuit is not equal to the emf of the cell. The reason is that charge moving through the electrolyte of the cell encounters resistance. We call this the internal resistance of the source, denoted by r. If this resistance behaves according to Ohm\u2019s law  r is  constant and independent of the current i. As the current moves through r, it experiences an associated  drop in potential equal to ir. Thus, when a current is drawn through a source, the potential difference between the terminals of the source is V E ir = \u2013 This can also be shown as below.  V E ir V A B \u2013 + =   or      V V E ir A B \u2013 \u2013 = 22 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism E r i A B Fig. 23.28  The following three special cases are possible :   (i) If the current flows in opposite direction (as in case of charging of a battery), then V E ir = +  (ii) V E = , if the current through the cell is zero. (iii) V = 0, if the cell is short circuited. This is because current in the circuit i E r = or  E ir =    \u2234 E ir \u2013 = 0           or  V = 0    Thus, we can summarise it as follows :  V E ir = \u2013 or V E <            V E ir = + or V E >           V E = if i = 0      V = 0  if short circuited Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 23 E r i E r i E r E r i = E r + 12 V iR = 8V E = 12V ir = 4V 4 \u2126 2 \u2126 2 A 12 V 8 V O r Fig. 23.30 Potential rise and fall in a circuit. E r Short circuited Fig. 23.29  \u0098 In figure (a) : There are eight wires and hence, will have eight currents or eight unknowns. The eight wires are AB BC CE EA AD , , , , , BD CD ,  and ED. Number of independent loops are four. Therefore, from the second law we can make only four equations. Total number of junctions are five (A, B, C, D and E). But by using the first law, we can make only four equations (one less). So, the total number of equations are eight. In figure (b) : Number of wires are six (AB, BC, CDA, BE, AE and CE). Number of independent loops are three so, three equations can be obtained  from the second law. Number of junctions are four (A, B, C and E) so, we can  make only three (one less) equations from the first law. But total number of equations are again six. \u0098 Short circuiting : Two points in an electric circuit directly connected by a conducting wire are called short circuited. Under such condition both points  are at same potential. For example, resistance R1 in the adjoining circuit is short circuited, i.e. potential difference across it is zero. Hence, no current will flow through R1 and the current through R2 is therefore, E R / 2. \u0098 Earthing : If some point of a circuit is earthed, then its potential is taken to be zero. For example, in the adjoining figure, V V A B = = 0 V V V   F C D = = = \u2013 3 V   VE = \u2013 9 V    \u2234 V V B E \u2013 = 9 V                    or current through 2 \u2126 resistance is  V V B E \u2013 2  or  9 2 A  (from B to E) Similarly,      V V A F \u2013 = 3 V and the current through 4 \u2126 resistance is  V V A F \u2013 4  or  3 4 A  (from A to F) \u0098 For a current flow through a resistance there must be a potential difference across it but between any two points of a circuit the potential difference may be zero. For example, in the circuit, net emf = 3 V and  net resistance = \u2126 6                 \u2234     current in the circuit,  i = = 3 6 1 2 A  V V A B \u2013   V V A B + \u00d7 = 1 2 1 2 \u2013  or V V A B \u2013 = 0      or by symmetry, we can say that       V V V A B C = =      So, the potential difference across any two vertices of the triangle is zero, while the current in the circuit is non-zero. 24 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism Extra Points to Remember A B C D E 4 1 2 3 (a) (b) A B C D E 1 2 3 Fig. 23.31 E ",

        "content": "Fig. 23.42  23.10 Heating Effects of Current An electric current through a resistor increases its thermal energy. Also, there are other situations in which an electric current can produce or absorb thermal energy. Power Supplied or Power Absorbed by a Battery When charges are transported across a source of emf, their potential energy changes. If a net charge  \u2206q moves through a potential difference E in a time \u2206t, the change in electric potential energy of the charge is E q \u2206. Thus, the source of emf does work, \u2206 \u2206 W E q = Dividing both sides by \u2206t, then taking the limit as \u2206t \u21920, we find dW dt E dq dt = By definition, dq dt i = , the current through the battery and dW dt P = , the power output of (or input to) the  battery. Hence, P Ei =   The quantity P represents the rate at which energy is transferred from a discharging battery or to a charging battery. In Fig. 23.43, energy is transferred from the source at a rate Ei In Fig. 23.44, energy is transferred to the source at a rate Ei Power dissipated across a resistance Now, let\u2019s consider the power dissipated in a conducting element. Suppose it has a resistance R and the potential difference between its ends is V. In moving from higher to lower potential, a positive charge \u2206q loses energy \u2206 \u2206 U V q = . This electric energy is absorbed by the conductor through collisions between its atomic lattice and the charge carriers, causing its temperature to rise. This effect is commonly called Joule heating. Since, power is the rate at which energy is transferred, we have,      P U t V q t V i = = \u22c5 = \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2234 P V i =                       which with the help of equation V iR =  can also be written in the forms, P i R = 2   or  P V R = 2 Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 27 E i Fig. 23.43 E i Fig. 23.44  Power is always dissipated in a resistance. With this rate, the heat produced in the resistor in time t is H Pt =  or  H Vit i Rt V R t = = = 2 2 Joule heating occurs whenever a current passes through an element that has resistance. To prevent the  overheating of delicate electronic components, many electric devices like video cassette recorders, televisions and computer monitors have fans in their chassis to allow some of the heat produced to escape. \u0098 We have seen above that power may be supplied or consumed by a battery. It depends on the direction of current. In the above direction of current power is supplied by the battery ( ) = Ei In the opposite direction of current shown in Fig. 23.47, power is consumed by the battery. This normally happens during charging of a battery. \u0098 A resistance always consumes power. It does not depend on the direction of current. In both cases shown in figure, power is only consumed and this power consumed is given by the formula. P i R V R Vi = = = 2 2 In the above equations V and i are the values across a resistance in which we wish to find the power consumed. \u0098 In any electrical circuit, law of conservation of energy is followed.

Case 1 When E and r of each cell has same value and positive terminals of all cells are connected at one junction while negative at the other. In this situation, the net emf is E. The net internal resistance is r n as n resistances each of r are in parallel. Net external resistance is R. Therefore, total resistance is r n R + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 and so the current in the circuit will be, i = Net emf Total resistance  or  i E R r n = + /  Note   A comparison of series and parallel grouping reveals that to get maximum current, cells must be connected in series if effective internal resistance is lesser than external and in parallel if effective internal  resistance is greater than external. Case 2 If E and r of each cell are different but still the positive terminals of all cells are connected at one junction while negative at the other.

There are n identical cells in a row and number of rows are m. Emf of each cell is E and internal resistance is r.

E r ,  and R are also given, we have liberty to arrange the given number of cells in different rows. Then in the above expression the numerator nmE and in the denominator 2 mnrR all are fixed. Only the square term in the denominator is variable. Therefore, i is maximum when,             mR nr =  or  R nr m =      or  total external resistance = total internal resistance Thus, we can say that the current and hence power transferred to the load is maximum when load resistance is equal to internal resistance. This is known as maximum power transfer theorem.

One we have discussed above, where we have to arrange the cells in such a manner that current and power in the circuit should be maximum.

Now, in this article we will study how these are measured. The basic measuring instrument is galvanometer, whose pointer shows a deflection when current passes through it. A galvanometer can easily be converted into an ammeter for measuring current, into a voltmeter for measuring potential difference. For accurate measurement of potential difference or emf, a potentiometer is more preferred. Resistances are accurately measured by using post office box or meter bridge which are based on the principle of \u201cWheatstone bridge\u201d. All these are discussed here one by one in brief. Galvanometer Many common devices including car instrument panels, battery chargers measure potential difference, current or resistance using d\u2019Arsonval Galvanometer. It consists of a pivoted coil placed in the magnetic field of a permanent magnet. Attached to the coil is a spring. In the equilibrium position, with no current in the coil, the pointer is at zero and spring is relaxed. When there is a current in the coil, the magnetic field exerts a torque on the coil that is proportional to current. As the coil turns, the spring exerts a restoring torque that is proportional to the angular displacement. Thus, the angular deflection of the coil and pointer is directly proportional to the coil current and the device can be calibrated to measure current. The maximum deflection, typically 90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0 is called full scale deflection. The essential electrical characteristics of the galvanometer are the current ig required for full scale deflection (of the order of 10 A \u00b5 to 10 mA) and the resistance G of the coil (of the order of 10 to 1000 \u2126). The galvanometer deflection is proportional to the current in the coil. If the coil obeys Ohm\u2019s law, the current is proportional to potential difference. The corresponding potential difference for full scale deflection is V i G g = Ammeter A current measuring instrument is called an ammeter. A galvanometer can be converted into an ammeter by connecting a small resistance S (called shunt) in parallel with it. Suppose we want to convert a galvanometer with full scale current ig and coil resistance G into an ammeter with full scale reading i. To determine the shunt resistance S needed, note that, at full scale deflection the total current through the parallel combination is i, the current through the galvanometer is ig and the current through the shunt is i ig \u2013 . The potential difference V V V ab a b ( \u2013 ) = is the same for both paths, so i G i i S g g = ( \u2013 ) \u2234 S i i i G g g = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7\uf8f7 \u2013 Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 37 G + \u2013 i a i i \u2013 g S ig b Fig. 23.68  Voltmeter A voltage measuring device is called a voltmeter. It measures the potential difference between two points. A galvanometer can be converted into a voltmeter by connecting a high resistance (R) in series with it. The whole assembly called the voltmeter is connected in parallel between the points where potential difference has to be measured. For a voltmeter with full scale reading V, we need a series resistor R such that V i G R g = + ( ) or R V i G g = \u2013 \u0098 Conversion of galvanometer into an ammeter. (i) A galvanometer is converted into an ammeter by connecting a low resistance (called shunt) in parallel with galvanometer. This assembly (called ammeter) is connected in series in the wire in which current is to be found. Resistance of an ideal ammeter should be zero. In parallel, current distributes in the inverse ratio of resistance. Therefore, S G i i i g g = \u2212 \u2234 S = shunt = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7\uf8f7 i i i G g g (ii) Resistance of an ammeter is given by 1 1 1 A G S = + \u21d2 A ",

Solution Here, ig = = 1.00 mA A 10 3 \u2013 , G = \u2126 20 , i = \u00d7 50.0 A 10 3 \u2013 Substituting in S i i i G g g = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7\uf8f7 = \u00d7 \u2013 ( ) ( ) ( ) \u2013 ( ) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 10 20 10 10 3 3 3 50.0 = \u2126 0.408 Ans. Note The resistance of ammeter is given by 1 1 1 1 20 1 A G S = + = + 0.408 or A = \u2126 0.4 The shunt resistance is so small in comparison to the galvanometer resistance that the ammeter resistance is very nearly equal to the shunt resistance. This shunt resistance gives us a low resistance ammeter with the desired range of 0 to 50.0 mA. At full scale deflection i mA = 50.0 , the current through the galvanometer is 1.0 mA while the current through the shunt is 49.0 mA. If the current i is less than 50.0 mA, the coil current and the deflection are proportionally less, but the ammeter resistance is still 0.4 \u2126. V Example 23.26 How can we make a galvanometer with G = \u2126 20 and i mA g = 1.0 into a voltmeter with a maximum range of 10 V? Solution Using R V i G g = \u2013 , We have, R = 10 10 20 3 \u2013 \u2013 = \u2126 9980 Ans. Thus, a resistance of 9980 \u2126is to be connected in series with the galvanometer to convert it into the voltmeter of desired range. Note At full scale deflection current through the galvanometer, the voltage drop across the galvanometer V i G volt g g = = \u00d7 20 10 3 \u2013 = 0.02 volt and the voltage drop across the series resistance R is V i R volt g = = \u00d7 9980 10 3 \u2013 = 9.98 volt or we can say that most of the voltage appears across the series resistor.

Solution To increase the range of an ammeter a low resistance has to be connected in parallel with galvanometer. Therefore, net resistance decreases. To increase the range of voltmeter, a high resistance has to be connected in series. So, net resistance further increases.

Potentiometer The potentiometer is an instrument that can be used to measure the emf or the internal resistance of an unknown source. It also has a number of other useful applications. Principle of Potentiometer The principle of potentiometer is schematically shown in figure. A resistance wire ab of total resistance Rab is permanently connected to the terminals of a source of known emf E1.A sliding contact c is connected through the galvanometer G to a second source whose emf E2 is to be measured. As contact c is moved along the potentiometer wire, the resistance Rcb between points c and b varies. If the resistance wire is uniform Rcb is proportional to the length of the wire between c and b. To determine the value of E2, contact c is moved until a position is found at 42 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 23.9 a b i i ",

Principle of Wheatstone\u2019s Bridge The scientist Wheatstone designed a circuit to find unknown resistance. Such a circuit is popularly known as Wheatstone\u2019s bridge. This is an arrangement of four resistances which can be used to measure one of them in terms of the rest. The figure shows the circuit designed by him. The bridge is said to be balanced when deflection in galvanometer is zero, i.e. ig = 0, and hence, V V B D = Under this condition, V V V V A B A D \u2013 \u2013 = or i P i R 1 2 = or i i R P 1 2 = \u2026(i) Similarly, V V V V B C D C \u2013 = \u2212 Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 47 E r A B R r = 15 r E 2 G J Fig. 23.84 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 23.10 i1 i1 ig = 0 i2 i2 A B C D i P Q R S G E Fig. 23.85  or i Q i S 1 2 = or i i S Q 1 2 = \u2026(ii) From Eqs.

To measure the resistance of an unknown resistor, it is connected as one of the four resistors in the bridge. One of the other three should be a variable resistor. Let us suppose P is the unknown resistance and Q is the variable resistance. The value of Q is so adjusted that deflection through the galvanometer is zero.

In carbon resistors, carbon with a suitable binding agent is molded into a cylinder. Wire leads are attached to this cylinder and the entire resistor is encased in a ceramic or plastic jacket. The two leads connect the resistor to a circuit. Carbon resistors are compact and inexpensive. Their values are given using a colour code.

Mobility The physical significance of mobility means how mobile the charge carriers are for the current flow. If mobility of charge carriers is more than we can say that current flow will be more. In metals, the mobile charge carriers are electrons. In an ionised gas they are electrons and positive charged ions. In an electrolyte, these can be positive and negative ions. In semiconductors, charge carriers are electrons and holes. Later, we will see that mobility of electrons (in semiconductor) is more than the mobility of holes. Mobility ( ) \u00b5 is defined as the magnitude of drift velocity per unit electric field. Thus, \u00b5 = v E d But, v eE m d = \u03c4 \u2234 \u00b5 \u03c4 = e m The SI units of mobility are m / V - s 2 . Therefore, practical units of mobility is cm / V - s. 2 Mobility of any charge carrier (whether it is electron, ion or hole) is always positive. 2.

Thermistor The temperature coefficient of resistivity is negative for semiconductors. This means that the resistivity decreases as we raise the temperature of such a material. The magnitude of the temperature coefficient of resistivity is often quite large for a semiconducting material. This fact is used to construct thermometers to detect small changes in temperatures. Such a device is called a thermistor. The variation of resistivity of a semiconductor with temperature is shown in figure. A typical thermistor can easily measure a change in temperature of the order of10 3 \u2013 \u00b0C Chapter 23 Current Electricity \u0097 57 Semiconductor T r  4. Superconductors Superconductivity was first discovered in 1911 by the Dutch physicist Heike Kamerlingh Onnes. There are certain materials, including several metallic alloys and oxides for which as the temperature decreases, the resistivity first decreases smoothly, like that of any metal. But then at a certain critical temperatureTc a phase transition occurs, and the resistivity suddenly drops to zero as shown in figure. Once, a current has been established in a superconducting ring, it continues indefinitely without the presence of any driving field. Possible applications of superconductors are ultrafast computer switches and transmission of electric power through superconducting power lines. However, the requirement of low temperature is posing difficulty. For instance the critical temperature for mercury is 4.2 K. Scientists are putting great effort to construct compounds and alloys which would be superconducting at room temperature (300 K). Superconductivity at around 125 K has already been achieved. 5. The \u03c1-T equation derived in article 23.6 can be derived from the relation, d dT \u03c1 \u03b1\u03c1 = or d dT \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03b1 = \u2234 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03b1 0 0 \u222b \u222b = d dT T T (if\u03b1 = constant) \u2026(i) \u2234 ln ( ) \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03b1 0 0 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= \u2212 T T \u2234 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03b1 = \u2212 0 0 e T T ( ) If \u03b1 is small, e T T \u03b1( ) \u2212 0 can approximately be written as1 0 + \u2212 \u03b1( ). T T Hence, \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03b1 = + \u2212 0 0 1 [ ( )] T T Which is the same result as we have discussed earlier. In the above discussion, we have assumed\u03b1 to be constant. If it is function of temperature it will come inside the integration in Eq. (i). 6. The principle of superposition Complex network problems can sometimes be solved easily by using the principle of superposition. This principle essentially states that when a number of emf\u2019s act in a network, the solution is the same as the superposition of the solutions for one emf acting at a time, the others being shorted. 7. Figure shows a network with two loops. The currents in various branches can be calculated using Kirchhoff\u2019s laws. We can get the same solution by considering only one battery at a time and then superposing the two solutions. If a battery has an internal resistance, it must be left in place when the emf of the battery is removed. Figure shows how the superposition principle can be applied to the present problem. 58 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism 4\u2126 12\u2126 8 \u2126 2 \u2126 14.4V 10.8V Superconductor T r Tc 0.4A 1A 4 \u2126 1A 12\u2126 8 \u2126 0.6A 2\u2126 0.4A 0.8A 4 \u2126 1.2A 12 \u2126 8 \u2126 2 \u2126 14.4V + (a) (b) 10.8V  The current values in Fig. (a) and (b) are easily verified. For example when the 10.8 V battery alone is acting, the total resistance in the circuit is 4 12 8 12 8 2 + \u00d7 + + = \u2126 10.8 This makes the total current 10.8 V 10.8 A \u2126=1 . This current splits between 8 \u2126and 12 \u2126in the ratio 3 2 : . Similarly, the total resistance when only the14.4 V battery is acting is 8 12 6 12 6 12 + \u00d7 + = \u2126 Therefore, the total current is 14.4 V 1.2 A 12 \u2126= . The superposition principle shows that there is no current in the 12 \u2126resistance. Only a current of 1.8 A flows through the outer loop. All these conclusions can be verified by analyzing the circuit using Kirchhoff\u2019s laws. 8. The equivalent emf of a cell can also be found by the following method. Suppose we wish to find the equivalent emf of the above circuit. We apply the fact that E V = When no current is drawn from the cell. But current in the internal circuit may be non-zero. This current is, i = + + = 10 4 2 1 14 3 A Now, V V A B + \u00d7 = 4 1 14 3 \u2013 \u2234 V V A B \u2013 \u2013 = = 14 3 4 2 3 V \u2234 E V V V A B = = = \u2013 2 3 V \u2234 E = 2 3 V Further,V V A B \u2013 is positive, i.e.V V A B > or A is connected to the positive terminal of the battery andB to the negative. Internal resistance of the equivalent battery is found by the normal procedure. For example, here 2 \u2126and1 \u2126resistances are in parallel.

Therefore, potential drop across them should be in direct ratio of resistance. So, using this concept we can find the potential difference across other resistors. For example, potential across 2 \u2126was 4 V. So, potential difference across 8 \u2126(which is four times of 2 \u2126) should be 16 V. Similarly, potential difference across 3 \u2126(which is 1.5 times of 2 \u2126) should be 1.5 times or 6 V.

Similar phenomena occur if we rub a glass rod or an amber rod with a cloth or with a piece of fur. Why does this happens? What really happens in an electric circuit? How do electric motors and generators work? The answers to all these questions come from a branch of physics known as electromagnetism, the study of electric and magnetic interactions. These interactions involve particles that have a property called electric charge, an inherent property of matter that is as fundamental as mass. We begin our study of electromagnetism in this chapter by the electric charge. We will see that it is quantized and obeys a conservation principle. Then we will study the interactions of electric charges that are at rest, called electrostatic interactions. These interactions are governed by a simple relationship known as Coulomb\u2019s law. This law is more conveniently described by using the concept of electric field. 24.2 Electric Charge The electrical nature of matter is inherent in atomic structure. An atom consists of a small, relatively massive nucleus that contains particles called protons and neutrons. A proton has a mass 1.673 kg \u00d7 \u2212 10 27 , while a neutron has a slightly greater mass1.675 10 kg. \u201327 \u00d7 Surrounding the nucleus is a diffuse cloud of orbiting particles called electrons. An electron has a mass of 9.11 kg \u00d7 \u2212 10 31 . Like mass, electric charge is an intrinsic property of protons and electrons, and only two types of charge have been discovered positive and negative. A proton has a positive charge, and an electron has a negative charge. A neutron has no net electric charge. The magnitude of the charge on the proton exactly equals the magnitude of the charge on the electron. The proton carries a charge +eand the electron carries a charge \u2212e. The SI unit of charge is coulomb ( ) C and e has the value e = \u00d7 \u2212 1.6 10 C 19 Regarding charge the following points are worth noting: 1. Like charges repel each other and unlike charges attract each other. 2. Charge is a scalar and can be of two types positive or negative. 3. Charge is quantized. The quantum of charge is e. The charge on any body will be some integral multiple of e, i.e. q ne = \u00b1 where, n = \u2026 1 2 3 , , Charge on any body can never be 1 3 e \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7,1.5e, etc. Note (i) Apart from charge, energy, angular momentum and mass are also quantized. The quantum of energy is h\u03bd and that of angular momentum is h 2\u03c0. Quantum of mass is not known till date. (ii) The protons and neutrons are combination of other entities called quarks, which have charges \u00b1 1 3 eand \u00b1 2 3 e. However, isolated quarks have not been observed. So, quantum of charge is still e. 110 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism  4. During any process, the net electric charge of an isolated system remains constant or we can say that charge is conserved. Pair production and pair annihilation are two examples of conservation of charge. 5. A charged particle at rest produces electric field. A charged particle in an unaccelerated motion produces both electric and magnetic fields but does not radiate energy. But an accelerated charged particle not only produces an electric and magnetic fields but also radiates energy in the form of electromagnetic waves. V Example 24.1 How many electrons are there in one coulomb of negative charge? Solution The negative charge is due to the presence of excess electrons, since they carry negative charge. Because an electron has a charge whose magnitude is e = \u00d7 \u2212 1.6 10 C 19 , the number of electrons is equal to the charge q divided by the charge e on each electron. Therefore, the number n of electrons is n q e = = \u00d7 \u2212 1.0 1.6 19 10 = \u00d7 6.25 1018 Ans. 24.3 Conductors and Insulators For the purpose of electrostatic theory, all substances can be divided into two main groups, conductors and insulators. In conductors, electric charges are free to move from one place to another, whereas in insulators they are tightly bound to their respective atoms. In an uncharged body, there are equal number of positive and negative charges. The examples of conductors of electricity are the metals, human body and the earth and that of insulators are glass, hard rubber and plastics. In metals, the free charges are free electrons known as conduction electrons. Semiconductors are a third class of materials and their electrical properties are somewhere between those of insulators and conductors. Silicon and germanium are well known examples of semiconductors. 24.4 Charging of a Body Mainly there are the following three methods of charging a body : Charging by Rubbing The simplest way to experience electric charges is to rub certain bodies against each other. When a glass rod is rubbed with a silk cloth, the glass rod acquires some positive charge and the silk cloth acquires negative charge by the same amount. The explanation of appearance of electric charge on rubbing is simple. All material bodies contain large number of electrons and equal number of protons in their normal state. When rubbed against each other, some electrons from one body pass onto the other body. The body that donates the electrons becomes positively charged while that which receives the electrons becomes negatively charged. For example, when glass rod is rubbed with silk cloth, glass rod becomes positively charged because it donates the electrons while the silk cloth Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 111  becomes negatively charged because it receives electrons. Electricity so obtained by rubbing two objects is also known as frictional electricity. The other places where the frictional electricity can be observed are when amber is rubbed with wool or a comb is passed through a dry hair. Clouds also become charged by friction. Charging by Contact When a negatively charged ebonite rod is rubbed on a metal object, such as a sphere, some of the excess electrons from the rod are transferred to the sphere. Once the electrons are on the metal sphere, where they can move readily, they repel one another and spread out over the sphere\u2019s surface. The insulated stand prevents them from flowing to the earth. When the rod is removed, the sphere is left with a negative charge distributed over its surface. In a similar manner, the sphere will be left with a positive charge after being rubbed with a positively charged rod. In this case, electrons from the sphere would be transferred to the rod. The process of giving one object a net electric charge by placing it in contact with another object that is already charged is known as charging by contact. Charging by Induction It is also possible to charge a conductor in a way that does not involve contact. In Fig. (a), a negatively charged rod brought close to (but does not touch) a metal sphere. In the sphere, the free electrons close to the rod move to the other side (by repulsion). As a result, the part of the sphere nearer to the rod becomes positively charged and the part farthest from the rod negatively charged. This phenomenon is called induction. Now, if the rod is removed, the free electrons return to their original places and the charged regions disappear. Under most conditions the earth is a good electric conductor. So, when a metal wire is attached between the sphere and the ground as in figure (b) some of the free electrons leave the sphere and distribute themselves on the much larger earth.

The process of giving one object a net electric charge without touching the object to a second charged object is called charging by induction. The process could also be used to give the sphere a net negative charge, if a positively charged rod were used. Then, electrons would be drawn up from the ground through the grounding wire and onto the sphere. If the sphere were made from an insulating material like plastic, instead of metal, the method of producing a net charge by induction would not work, because very little charge would flow through the insulating material and down the grounding wire. However, the electric force of the charged rod would have some effect as shown in figure. The electric force would cause the positive and negative charges in the molecules of the insulating material to separate slightly, with the negative charges being pushed away from the negative rod. The surface of the plastic sphere does acquire a slight induced positive charge, although no net charge is created. V Example 24.2 If we comb our hair on a dry day and bring the comb near small pieces of paper, the comb attracts the pieces, why? Solution This is an example of frictional electricity and induction. When we comb our hair, it gets positively charged by rubbing. When the comb is brought near the pieces of paper some of the electrons accumulate at the edge of the paper piece which is closer to the comb. At the farther end of the piece there is deficiency of electrons and hence, positive charge appears there. Such a redistribution of charge in a material, due to presence of a nearby charged body is called inducion. The comb exerts larger attraction on the negative charges of the paper piece as compared to the repulsion on the positive charge. This is because the negative charges are closer to the comb. Hence, there is a net attraction between the comb and the paper piece. V Example 24.3 Does the attraction between the comb and the piece of papers last for longer period of time? Solution No, because the comb loses its net charge after some time. The excess charge of the comb transfers to earth through our body after some time. V Example 24.4 Can two similarly charged bodies attract each other? Solution Yes, when the charge on one body ( ) q1 is much greater than that on the other ( ) q2 and they are close enough to each other so that force of attraction between q1 and induced charge on the other exceeds the force of repulsion between q1 and q2. However, two similar point charges can never attract each other because no induction will take place here. V Example 24.5 Does in charging the mass of a body change? Solution Yes, as charging a body means addition or removal of electrons and electron has a mass.

Solution All electric appliances may end with some charge due to faulty connections. In such a situation charge will be accumulated on the appliance. When the user touches the appliance, he may get a shock. By providing the third hole for grounding all accumulated charge is discharged to the ground and the appliance is safe. 1.

What is the total charge, in coulombs, of all the electrons in three gram mole of hydrogen atom? 24.5 Coulomb\u2019s Law The law that describes how charges interact with one another was discovered by Charles Augustin de Coulomb in 1785. With a sensitive torsion balance, Coulomb measured the electric force between charged spheres. In Coulomb\u2019s experiment, the charged spheres were much smaller than the distance between them so that the charges could be treated as point charges. The results of the experiments of Coulomb and others are summarized in Coulomb\u2019s law. The electric force Fe exerted by one point charge on another acts along the line between the charges. It varies inversely as the square of the distance separating the charges and is proportional to the product of charges. The force is repulsive if the charges have the same sign and attractive if the charges have opposite signs. The magnitude of the electric force exerted by a charge q1 on another charge q2 a distance r away is thus, given by F k q q r e = | | 1 2 2 \u2026(i) The value of the proportionality constant k in Coulomb\u2019s law depends on the system of units used. In SI units the constant k is k = \u00d7 8.987551787 N-m C 2 2 109 \u2248 \u00d7 8.988 N-m C 2 2 109 The value of k is known to such a large number of significant digits because this value is closely related to the speed of light in vacuum. This speed is defined to be exactly c = \u00d7 2.99792458 m/s 108 . The numerical value of k is defined in terms of c to be precisely. k c = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u2212 10 7 2 N- s C 2 2 114 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 24.1  This constant k is often written as 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 , where \u03b5 0 (\u201cepsilon-nought\u201d) is another constant. This appears to complicate matters, but it actually simplifies many formulae that we will encounter in later chapters. Thus, Eq. (i) can be written as F q q r e = 1 4 0 1 2 2 \u03c0\u03b5 | | \u2026(ii) Here, 1 4 10 0 7 2 \u03c0\u03b5 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u2212N-s C 2 2 c Substituting value of c = \u00d7 2.99792458 m/s 108 , we get 1 4 10 0 9 2 \u03c0 \u03b5 = \u00d7 8.99 N-m/C In examples and problems, we will often use the approximate value 1 4 10 0 9 2 2 \u03c0\u03b5 = \u00d7 9.0 N-m /C Here, the quantity \u03b5 0 is called the permittivity of free space. It has the value, \u03b5 0 12 10 = \u00d7 8.854 C N-m 2 2 \u2013 / Regarding Coulomb\u2019s law, the  following points are worth noting: 1. Coulomb\u2019s law stated above describes the interaction of two point charges. When two charges exert forces simultaneously on a third charge, the total force acting on that charge is the vector sum of the forces that the two charges would exert individually. This important property, called the principle of superposition of forces, holds for any number of charges. Thus, F F F F net = + +\u2026 + 1 2 n 2. The electric force is an action reaction pair, i.e. the two charges exert equal and opposite forces on each other. 3. The electric force is conservative in nature. 4. Coulomb\u2019s law as we have stated above can be used for point charges in vacuum. If some dielectric is present in the space between the charges, the net force acting on each charge is altered because charges are induced in the molecules of the intervening medium. We will describe this effect later. Here at this moment it is enough to say that the force decreases K times if the medium extends till infinity. Here, K is a dimensionless constant which depends on the medium and called dielectric constant of the medium. Thus, F q q r e = \u22c5 1 4 0 1 2 2 \u03c0\u03b5 (in vacuum) F F K K q q r q q r e e \u2032 = = \u22c5 = \u22c5 1 4 1 4 0 1 2 2 1 2 2 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5 (in medium) Here, \u03b5 \u03b5 = 0K is called permittivity of the medium.

Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 119 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 24.2  24.6 Electric Field A charged particle cannot directly interact with another particle kept at a distance. A charge produces something called an electric field in the space around it and this electric field exerts a force on any other charge (except the source charge itself) placed in it. Thus, the region surrounding a charge or distribution of charge in which its electrical effects can be observed is called the electric field of the charge or distribution of charge. Electric field at a point can be defined in terms of either a vector function Ecalled \u2018electric field strength\u2019 or a scalar function V called \u2018electric potential\u2019. The electric field can also be visualised graphically in terms of \u2018lines of force\u2019. Note that all these are functions of position r ( , , ) x y z . The field propagates through space with the speed of light, c. Thus, if a charge is suddenly moved, the force it exerts on another charge a distance r away does not change until a time r /c later. In our forgoing discussion, we will see that electric field strength E and electric potential V are interrelated. It is similar to a case where the acceleration, velocity and displacement of a particle are related to each other. Electric Field Strength ( ) E Like its gravitational counterpart, the electric field strength (often called electric field) at a point in an electric field is defined as the electrostatic force Fe per unit positive charge. Thus, if the electrostatic force experienced by a small test charge q0 is Fe, then field strength at that point is defined as E F = \u2192 lim q e q 0 0 0 The electric field is a vector quantity and its direction is the same as the direction of the force Fe on a positive test charge. The SI unit of electric field is N/C. Here, it should be noted that the test charge q0 should be infinitesimally small so that it does not disturb other charges which produces E. With the concept of electric field, our description of electric interactions has two parts. First, a given charge distribution acts as a source of electric field. Second, the electric field exerts a force on any charge that is present in this field. An Electric Field Leads to a Force Suppose there is an electric field strength E at some point in an electric field, then the electrostatic force acting on a charge +q is qE in the direction of E, while on the charge \u2013 q it is qE in the opposite direction of E. V Example 24.10 An electric field of 105 N/C points due west at a certain spot. What are the magnitude and direction of the force that acts on a charge of + 2 \u00b5C and \u22125 \u00b5C at this spot? Solution Force on + = 2\u00b5C qE = \u00d7 ( ) ( ) \u2013 2 10 10 6 5 = 0.2 N (due west) Ans. Force on \u2013 5 C (5 10 ) (10 ) \u20136 5 \u00b5 = \u00d7 = 0.5 N (due east) Ans. 120 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism  Electric Field Due to a Point Charge The electric field produced by a point charge q can be obtained in general terms from Coulomb\u2019s law. First note that the magnitude of the force exerted by the charge q on a test charge q0 is F qq r e = \u22c5 1 4 0 0 2 \u03c0 \u03b5 then divide this value by q0 to obtain the magnitude of the field. E q r = \u22c5 1 4 0 2 \u03c0\u03b5 If q is positive, E is directed away from q. On the other hand, if q is negative, then E is directed towards q. The electric field at a point is a vector quantity. Suppose E1 is the field at a point due to a charge q1 and E2 in the field at the same point due to a charge q2. The resultant field when both the charges are present is E E E = + 1 2 If the given charge distribution is continuous, we can use the technique of integration to find the resultant electric field at a point. V Example 24.11 Two positive point charges q C 1 16 = \u00b5 and q C 2 4 = \u00b5 , are separated in vacuum by a distance of 3.0 m. Find the point on the line between the charges where the net electric field is zero. Solution Between the charges the two field contributions have opposite directions, and the net electric field is zero at a point (say P) where the magnitudes of E1 and E2 are equal. However, since q q 2 1 < , point P must be closer to q2, in order that the field of the smaller charge can balance the field of the larger charge. At P, E E 1 2 = or 1 4 1 4 0 1 1 2 0 2 2 2 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5 q r q r = \u22c5 Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 121 + q1 + P ",

Ans. Electric Field of a Ring of Charge A conducting ring of radius R has a total charge q uniformly distributed over its circumference. We are interested in finding the electric field at point P that lies on the axis of the ring at a distance x from its centre. We divide the ring into infinitesimal segments of length dl. Each segment has a charge dq and acts as a point charge source of electric field. Let dEbe the electric field from one such segment; the net electric field at P is then the sum of all contributions dEfrom all the segments that make up the ring. If we consider two ring segments at the top and bottom of the ring, we see that the contributions dEto the field at P from these segments have the same x-component but opposite y-components. Hence, the total y-component of field due to this pair of segments is zero. When we add up the contributions from all such pairs of segments, the total field E will have only a component along the ring\u2019s symmetry axis (the x-axis) with no component perpendicular to that axis (i.e. no y or z-component). So, the field at P is described completely by its x-component Ex.

Electric Field of a Line Charge Positive charge q is distributed uniformly along a line with length 2a, lying along the y-axis between y a = \u2013 and y a = + .

(ii) if we make the line of charge longer and longer, adding charge in proportion to the total length so that \u03bb, the charge per unit length remains constant. In this case, Eq.

The direction of E is radially outward from the line. Note Suppose a charge q is placed at a point whose position vector is rq and we want to find the electric field at a point P whose position vector is rP.

Electric Field Lines As we have seen, electric charges create an electric field in the space surrounding them. It is useful to have a kind of \u201cmap\u201d that gives the direction and indicates the strength of the field at various places. Field lines, a concept introduced by Michael Faraday, provide us with an easy way to visualize the electric field. Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 125 E \u221d1 r E r Fig. 24.15  \u201cAn electric field line is an imaginary line or curve drawn through a region of space so that its tangent at any point is in the direction of the electric field vector at that point. The relative closeness of the lines at some place give an idea about the intensity of electric field at that point.\u201d The electric field lines have the following properties : 1. The tangent to a line at any point gives the direction of E at that point. This is also the path on which a positive test charge will tend to move if free to do so. 2. Electric field lines always begin on a positive charge and end on a negative charge and do not start or stop in mid-space. 3. The number of lines leaving a positive charge or entering a negative charge is proportional to the magnitude of the charge. This means, for example that if 100 lines are drawn leaving a + 4\u00b5C charge then 75 lines would have to end on a \u20133\u00b5C charge. 4. Two lines can never intersect. If it happens then two tangents can be drawn at their point of intersection, i.e. intensity at that point will have two directions which is absurd. 5. In a uniform field, the field lines are straight parallel and uniformly spaced. 6. The electric field lines can never form closed loops as a line can never start and end on the same charge. 126 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism q \u2013q (a) (b) (c) + \u2013 q q + (d) + q q \u2013 (e) \u2013q \u2013 q + q 2q \u2013 (f) Fig. 24.17 ",

Find the electric field at (3 m, 4 m, 0). 24.7 Electric Potential Energy The electric force between two charges is directed along the line of the charges and depends on the inverse square of their separation, the same as the gravitational force between two masses. Like the gravitational force, the electric force is conservative, so there is a potential energy function U associated with it. When a charged particle moves in an electric field, the field exerts a force that can do work on the particle. This work can always be expressed in terms of electric potential energy. Just as gravitational potential energy depends on the height of a mass above the earth\u2019s surface, electric potential energy depends on the position of the charged particle in the electric field, when a force F acts on a particle that moves from point a to point b, the work Wa b \u2192 done by the force is given by Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 127 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 24.3 B A Fig. 24.18 q1 q2 q3 Fig. 24.19  W d F ds a b a b a b \u2192 = \u22c5 = \u222b \u222b F s cos \u03b8 where, dsis an infinitesimal displacement along the particle\u2019s path and\u03b8 is the angle between Fand ds at each point along the path. Second, if the force F is conservative, the work done by F can always be expressed in terms of a potential energy U. When the particle moves from a point where the potential energy isUa to a point where it isUb , the change in potential energy is, \u2206U U U b a = \u2013 . This is related by the workWa b \u2192 as W U U U U U a b a b b a \u2192 = = = \u2013 \u2013 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 \u2206 \u2026(i) Here, Wa b \u2192 is the work done in displacing the particle from a to b by the conservative force (here electrostatic) not by us. Moreover we can see from Eq. (i) that if Wa b \u2192 is positive, \u2206U is negative and the potential energy decreases. So, whenever the work done by a conservative force is positive, the potential energy of the system decreases and vice-versa. That\u2019s what happens when a particle is thrown upwards, the work done by gravity is negative, and the potential energy increases. V Example 24.13 A uniform electric field E0 is directed along positive y-direction. Find the change in electric potential energy of a positive test charge q0 when it is displaced in this field from y a i = to y a f = 2 along the y-axis. Solution Electrostatic force on the test charge, F q E e = 0 0 (along positive y-direction) \u2234 W U i f \u2212 = \u2013 \u2206 or \u2206U Wi f = \u2212 \u2013 = \u2013 [ ( \u2013 )] q E a a 0 0 2 = \u2013 q E a 0 0 Ans. Note Here, work done by electrostatic force is positive. Hence, the potential energy is decreasing. Electric Potential Energy of Two Charges The idea of electric potential energy is not restricted to the special case of a uniform electric field as in example 24.13. Let us now calculate the work done on a test charge q0 moving in a non-uniform electric field caused by a single, stationary point charge q. The Coulomb\u2019s force on q0 at a distance r from a fixed charge q is F qq r = \u22c5 1 4 0 0 2 \u03c0\u03b5 If the two charges have same signs, the force is repulsive and if the two charges have opposite signs, the force is attractive. The force is not constant during the displacement, so we have to integrate to calculate the work Wa b \u2192 done on q0 by this force as q0 moves from a to b. 128 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism ",

In this expression both the charges q and q0 are to be substituted with sign. The potential energy is positive if the charges q and q0 have the same sign and negative if they have opposite signs. Note that the above equation is derived by assuming that one of the charges is fixed and the other is displaced. However, the potential energy depends essentially on the separation between the charges and is independent of the spatial location of the charged particles. We emphasize that the potential energy U given by the above equation is a shared property of two charges q and q0, it is a consequence of the interaction between these two charges. If the distance between the two charges is changed from ra to rb , the change in the potential energy is the same whether q is held fixed and q0 is moved or q0 is held fixed and q is moved. For this reason we will never use the phrase \u2018the electric potential energy of a point charge\u2019. Electric Potential Energy of a System of Charges The electric potential energy of a system of charges is given by U q q r i j ij i j = <\u2211 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 This sum extends over all pairs of charges. We don\u2019t let i j = , because that would be an interaction of a charge with itself, and we include only terms with i j < to make sure that we count each pair only once. Thus, to account for the interaction between q5 and q4, we include a term with i = 4 and j = 5 but not a term with i = 5 and j = 4. For example, electric potential energy of four point charges q q q 1 2 3 , , and q4 would be given by U q q r q q r q q r q q r q q r q q = + + + + + 1 4 0 4 3 43 4 2 42 4 1 41 3 2 32 3 1 31 2 \u03c0\u03b5 1 21 r \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa \u2026(ii) Here, all the charges are to be substituted with sign.

Is it possible to have an arrangement of two point charges separated by finite distances such that the electric potential energy of the arrangement is the same as if the two charges were infinitely far apart? What if there are three charges? 24.8 Electric Potential As we have discussed in Article 24.6 that an electric field at any point can be defined in two different ways: (i) by the field strength E, and (ii) by the electric potential V at the point under consideration. Both Eand V are functions of position and there is a fixed relationship between these two. Of these, the field strength Eis a vector quantity while the electric potential V is a scalar quantity. In this article, 132 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 24.4  we will discuss about the electric potential and in the next, the relationship between E and V. \u201cPotential is the potential energy per unit charge.\u201d Electric potential at any point in an electric field is defined as the potential energy per unit charge, same as the field strength is defined as the force per unit charge. Thus, V U q = 0 or U q V = 0 The SI unit of potential is volt (V) which is equal to joule per coulomb. So, 1 1 V J/C = The work done by the electrostatic force in displacing a test charge q0 from a to b in an electric field is defined as the negative of change in potential energy between them, or \u2206U Wa b = \u2013 \u2013 \u2234 U U W b a a b \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 = We divide this equation by q0 U q U q W q b a a b 0 0 0 \u2212 = \u2013 \u2013 or V V W q a b a b \u2013 \u2013 = 0 as V U q = 0 Thus, the work done per unit charge by the electric force when a charged body moves from a to b is equal to the potential at a minus the potential at b. We sometimes abbreviate this difference as V V V ab a b = \u2013 . Another way to interpret the potential difference Vab is that the potential at a minus potential at b, equals the work that must be done to move a unit positive charge slowly from b to a against the electric force. V V W q a b b a \u2013 ( ) \u2013 = external force 0 Absolute Potential at Some Point Suppose we take the point b at infinity and as a reference point assign the value Vb = 0, the above equations can be written as V V W q W q a b a b b a \u2013 ( ) ( ) \u2013 \u2013 = = electric force external force 0 0 or V W q W q a a a = = \u221e \u221e ( ) ( ) \u2013 \u2013 electric force external force 0 0 Thus, the absolute electric potential at point a in an electric field can be defined as the work done in displacing a unit positive test charge from infinity to a by the external force or the work done per unit positive charge in displacing it from a to infinity. Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 133  Note The following three formulae are very useful in the problems related to work done in electric field. ( ) ( \u2013 ) \u2013 W q V V a b electric force a b = 0 ( ) ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ( ) \u2013 \u2013 W q V V W a b external force b a a b electric force = = 0 ( ) \u2013 W q V a external force a \u221e = 0 Here, q Va 0, and Vb are to be substituted with sign. V Example 24.17 The electric potential at point A is 20 V and at B is \u2013 40 V. Find the work done by an external force and electrostatic force in moving an electron slowly from B to A. Solution Here, the test charge is an electron, i.e. q0 19 10 = \u00d7 \u2013 \u2013 1.6 C VA = 20 V and VB = \u2013 40 V Work done by external force ( ) ( \u2013 ) \u2013 W q V V B A A B external force = 0 = \u00d7 (\u2013 ) [( ) \u2013 (\u2013 )] \u2013 1.6 10 20 40 19 = \u00d7 \u2013 \u2013 9.6 J 10 18 Ans. Work done by electric force ( ) \u2013 ( ) \u2013 \u2013 W W B A B A electric force external force = = \u00d7 \u2013 (\u2013 ) \u2013 9.6 J 10 18 = \u00d7 9.6 J 10 18 \u2013 Ans. Note Here, we can see that the electron (a negative charge) moves from B (lower potential) to A (higher potential) and the work done by electric force is positive. Therefore, we may conclude that whenever a negative charge moves from a lower potential to higher potential work done by the electric force is positive or when a positive charge moves from lower potential to higher potential the work done by the electric force is negative. V Example 24.18 Find the work done by some external force in moving a charge q C = 2 \u00b5 from infinity to a point where electric potential is 104 V . Solution Using the relation, ( ) \u2013 W qV a a \u221e = external force We have, ( ) ( ) ( ) \u2013 \u2013 W a \u221e = \u00d7 external force 2 10 10 6 4 = \u00d7 2 10 2 \u2013 J Ans. Electric Potential Due to a Point Charge q From the definition of potential, V U q = 0 = \u22c5 1 4 0 0 0 \u03c0\u03b5 q q r q 134 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism  or V q r = \u22c5 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 Here, r is the distance from the point charge q to the point at which the potential is evaluated. If q is positive, the potential that it produces is positive at all points; if q is negative, it produces a potential that is negative everywhere. In either case, V is equal to zero at r = \u221e. Electric Potential Due to a System of Charges Just as the electric field due to a collection of point charges is the vector sum of the fields produced by each charge, the electric potential due to a collection of point charges is the scalar sum of the potentials due to each charge. V q r i i i = \u2211 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 In this expression, ri is the distance from the i th charge, qi , to the point at which V is evaluated. For a continuous distribution of charge along a line, over a surface or through a volume, we divide the charge into elements dq and the sum in the above equation becomes an integral, V dq r = \u222b 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 Note In the equation V q r i i i = 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03a3 or V dq r = \u222b 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 , if the whole charge is at equal distance r0 from the point where V is to be evaluated, then we can write, V q r net = \u22c5 1 4 0 0 \u03c0\u03b5 where, qnet is the algebraic sum of all the charges of which the system is made. Here there are few examples : Example (i) Four charges are placed on the vertices of a square as shown in figure.

Thus, potential varies with distance r as shown in figure. In the figure, V q R 0 0 1 4 = \u22c5 \u03c0\u03b5 Electric Potential on the Axis of a Uniformly Charged Disc Let us find the electric potential at any point P, a distance x on the axis of a uniformly charged circular disc, having surface charge density\u03c3. Let us divide the disc into a large number of thin circular strips and consider a strip of radius r and width dr. Each point of this strip can be assumed to be at equal distance r x 2 2 + from point P. Potential at P due to this circular strip is dV dq r x = \u22c5 + 1 4 0 2 2 \u03c0\u03b5 Here, dq = \u03c3 ( ) area of strip or dq rdr = \u03c3 \u03c0 ( ) 2 \u2234 dV rdr r x = \u22c5 + 1 4 2 0 2 2 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03c3 \u03c0 ( ) Thus, the potential due to the whole disc is V dV R = \u222b0 = + \u222b \u03c3 \u03b5 2 0 2 2 0 rdr r x R or V R x x = + \u03c3 \u03b5 2 0 2 2 [ \u2013 ] Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 137 x P r dr Fig. 24.31 ",

This is the relation as obtained due to a point charge. Thus, at far away points, the distribution of charge becomes insignificant. It is difficult to calculate the potential at the points other than on the axis. However, potential on the edge of the disc can be calculated as under. Potential on the Edge of the Disc To calculate the potential at point P, let us divide the disc in large number of rings with P as centre. The potential due to one segment between r and r dr + is given as dV dq r = \u22c5 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 Here, dq = \u03c3 (Area of ring) = \u03c3 \u03b8 ( ) 2r dr \u2234 dV r dr r = \u22c5 1 4 2 0 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03c3 \u03b8 ( ) = \u22c5 \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03b8 2 0 dr Further, r R = 2 cos \u03b8 \u2234 dr R d = \u2013 sin 2 \u03b8 \u03b8 Hence, dV R d = \u2013 sin \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 2 2 0 \u2234 V dV = \u222b\u03c0/2 0 = \u222b \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 0 \u03c0/2 R d 0 sin Solving, we get V R = \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b5 0 \u2026(ii) Comparing Eqs.

The vector quantity related to this force is known as electric field. Further, a work is done by this electrostatic force when this test charge is moved from one point to another point. The scalar quantity related to this work done is called potential. Electric field ( ) E and potential ( ) V are different at different positions. So, they are functions of position. In a cartesian coordinate system, position of a particle can be represented by three variable coordinates x y , and z. Therefore, E andV are functions of three variables x y z , and . In physics, we normally keep least number of variables. So, sometimes E andV are the functions of a single variable x or r. Here, x is the x-coordinate along x-axis and r normally a distance from a point charge or from the centre of a charged sphere or charged spherical shell. From the x-coordinate, we can cover only x-axis. But, from the variable r, we can cover the whole space. Now, E and V functions are related to each other either by differentiation or integration. As far as differentiation is concerned, if there are more than one variables then partial differentiation is done and in case of single variable direct differentiation is required. In case of integration, some limit is required. Limit means value of the function which we get after integration should be known to us at some position. For example, after integrating E, we get V. So, value ofV should be known at some given position. Without knowing some limit, an unknown in the form of constant of integration remains in the equation. One known limit of V is : potential is zero at infinity. Conversion of V function into E function This requires differentiation. Case 1 When variables are more than one In this case, E i j k = + + E E E x y z $ $ $ Here, E V x V x x = \u2202 \u2202 = \u2013 \u2013 (partial derivative of w.r.t. ) E V y V y y = \u2202 \u2202 = \u2013 \u2013 (partial derivative of w.r.t. ) E V z V z z = \u2202 \u2202 = \u2013 \u2013 (partial derivative of w.r.t. ) \u2234 E i j k = \u2212\u2202 \u2202 + \u2202 \u2202 + \u2202 \u2202 \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa V x V y V z $ $ $ This is also sometimes written as E = = = \u2207 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 gradient grad V V V V Example 24.22 The electric potential in a region is represented as V x y z = + 2 3 \u2013 obtain expression for electric field strength. 140 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism  Solution E i j k = \u2202 \u2202 + \u2202 \u2202 + \u2202 \u2202 \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa \u2013 $ $ $ V x V y V z Here, \u2202 \u2202 = \u2202 \u2202 + = V x x x y z ( \u2013 ) 2 3 2 \u2202 \u2202 = \u2202 \u2202 + = V y y x y z ( \u2013 ) 2 3 3 \u2202 \u2202 = \u2202 \u2202 + = V z z x y z ( \u2013 ) \u2013 2 3 1 \u2234 E i j + k = \u2212 \u2212 2 3 $ $ $ Ans. Case 2 When variable is only one In this case, electric potential is function of only one variable ( ) say r and we can write the expression like : E dV dr = \u2212 or E = \u2212slope of V r- graph Example Electric potential due to a point charge q at distance r is given as V q r = \u22c5 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 \u21d2 dV dr q r = \u2212 \u03b5 \u22c5 1 4 0 2 \u03c0 \u2234 E dV dr q r = \u2212 = \u03b5 \u22c5 1 4 0 2 \u03c0 and we know that this is the expression of electric field due to a point charge. Note E is a vector quantity. In the above method, if single variable is x and E comes out to be positive, then direction of E is towards  positive x-axis. Negative value of E means direction is towards negative x axis - . If variable is r, then positive value of E means away from the point charge or away from the centre of charged spherical body and negative value of E means towards the charge or towards the centre of charged spherical body. Let us take an another example : We wish to find E r- graph corresponding toV r- graph shown in Fig. 24.35. Electric field E = \u2013 5V/m for 0 2 \u2264 \u2264 r m as slope of V-r graph is 5 V/m. E = 0 for 2 4 m m \u2264 \u2264 r as slope of V-r graph in this region is zero. Similarly, E = 5 V/m for 4 6 m m \u2264 \u2264 r as slope in this region is \u2013 5 V/m. So, the corresponding E r - graph is as shown in Fig. 24.36.

Conversion of E into V We have learnt, how to find electric field Efrom the electrostatic potential V.

On a topographic map, contour lines are drawn passing through the points having the same elevation. The potential energy of a mass m does not change along a contour line as the elevation is same everywhere. By analogy to contour lines on a topographic map, an equipotential surface is a three-dimensional surface on which the electric potential V is the same at every point on it. An equipotential surface has the following characteristics. 1. Potential difference between any two points in an equipotential surface is zero. 2. If a test charge q0 is moved from one point to the other on such a surface, the electric potential energy q V 0 remains constant. 3. No work is done by the electric force when the test charge is moved along this surface. 4. Two equipotential surfaces can never intersect each other because otherwise the point of intersection will have two potentials which is of course not possible. 5. As the work done by electric force is zero when a test charge is moved along the equipotential surface, it follows that E must be perpendicular to the surface at every point so that the electric force q0 E will always be perpendicular to the displacement of a charge moving on the surface. Thus, field lines and equipotential surfaces are always mutually perpendicular. Some equipotential surfaces are shown in Fig. 24.43. The equipotential surfaces are a family of concentric spheres for a point charge or a sphere of charge and are a family of concentric cylinders for a line of charge or cylinder of charge. For a special case of a uniform field, where the field lines are straight, parallel and equally spaced the equipotential surfaces are parallel planes perpendicular to the field lines. Note While drawing the equipotential surfaces we should keep in mind the two main points. (i) These are perpendicular to field lines at all places. (ii) Field lines always flow from higher potential to lower potential. V Example 24.29 Equipotential spheres are drawn round a point charge. As we move away from the charge, will the spacing between two spheres having a constant potential difference decrease, increase or remain constant. 146 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism + 40V 30V 20V 10V \u2013 10V 20V 30V 40V 40 V 30 V 20 V E Fig. 24.43  Solution V V 1 2 > V q r 1 0 1 1 4 = \u22c5 \u03c0\u03b5 and V q r 2 0 2 1 4 = \u22c5 \u03c0\u03b5 Now, V V q r r q r r r r 1 2 0 1 2 0 2 1 1 2 4 1 1 4 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c0\u03b5 \u03c0\u03b5 \u2234 ( \u2013 ) ( ) ( \u2013 ) ( ) r r V V q r r 2 1 0 1 2 1 2 4 = \u03c0\u03b5 For a constant potential difference ( \u2013 ) V V 1 2 , r r r r 2 1 1 2 \u2013 \u221d i.e. the spacing between two spheres ( \u2013 ) r r 2 1 increases as we move away from the charge, because the product r r 1 2 will increase. 24.11 Electric Dipole A pair of equal and opposite point charges \u00b1q, that are separated by a fixed distance is known as electric dipole. Electric dipole occurs in nature in a variety of situations. The hydrogen fluoride molecule (HF) is typical. When a hydrogen atom combines with a fluorine atom, the single electron of the former is strongly attracted to the later and spends most of its time near the fluorine atom. As a result, the molecule consists of a strongly negative fluorine ion some (small) distance away from a strongly positive ion, though the molecule is electrically neutral overall. Every electric dipole is characterized by its electric dipole moment which is a vector pdirected from the negative to the positive charge. The magnitude of dipole moment is p a q = ( ) 2 Here, 2a is the distance between the two charges. Electric Potential and Field Due to an Electric Dipole Consider an electric dipole lying along positive y-direction with its centre at origin. p j = 2aq $ The electric potential due to this dipole at point A x y z ( , , ) as shown is simply the sum of the potentials due to the two charges.

A uniform electric field is shown by parallel equidistant lines. The field due to a point charge or due to an electric dipole is non-uniform in nature. Uniform electric field is found between the plates of a parallel plate capacitor. Now, let us discuss the behaviour of a dipole in uniform electric field. Force on Dipole Suppose an electric dipole of dipole moment | |p = 2aq is placed in a uniform electric field E at an angle \u03b8. Here, \u03b8 is the angle between p and E. A force F E 1 = q will act on positive charge and F E 2 = \u2013 q on negative charge. Since, F1 and F2 are equal in magnitude but opposite in direction.

Potential Energy of Dipole When an electric dipole is placed in an electric field E, a torque \u03c4 = \u00d7 p E acts on it. If we rotate the dipole through a small angle d\u03b8, the work done by the torque is dW d = \u03c4 \u03b8 dW pE d = \u2013 sin \u03b8 \u03b8 The work is negative as the rotation d\u03b8 is opposite to the torque.

But torque acting on it is zero only at\u03b8 = \u00b0 0 and 180\u00b0. Thus, we can say that at these two positions of the dipole, net force and torque on it is zero or the dipole is in equilibrium Of this, \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 is the stable equilibrium position of the dipole because potential energy in this position is minimum ( \u2013 cos \u2013 ) U pE pE = \u00b0 = 0 and when displaced from this position a torque starts acting on it which is restoring in nature and which has a tendency to bring the dipole back in its equilibrium position. On the other hand, at \u03b8 = \u00b0 180 , the potential energy of the dipole is maximum ( \u2013 cos U pE = \u00b0 180 = + pE) and when it is displaced from this position, the torque has a tendency to rotate it in other direction. This torque is not restoring in nature. So, this equilibrium is known as unstable equilibrium position. Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 151 p \u2013q +q E E \u2013q +q ",

Many physical systems have symmetry, for example a cylindrical body doesn\u2019t look any different if we rotate it around its axis. Before studying the detailed discussion of Gauss's law let us understand electric flux. Electric Flux ( ) \u03c6 (i) Electric flux is a measure of the field lines crossing a surface. (ii) It is a scalar quantity with SI units N C - m 2 or V- m. Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 153 \u2013 + q q Fig. 24.50  (iii) Electric flux passing through a small surface dS is given by d d EdS \u03c6 = \u22c5 = E S cos \u03b8 \u2026(i) Here, dS is an area vector, whose magnitude is equal to dS and whose direction is perpendicular to the surface. Note If the surface is open, then dS can be taken in either of the two directions perpendicular to the surface, but it should not change even if we rotate the surface. If the surface is closed then by convention, dS is normally taken in outward direction. (iv) From Eq. (i), we can see that maximum value of d\u03c6 is EdS, if \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 or electric lines are perpendicular to the surface. Electric flux is zero, if \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 or electric lines are tangential to the surface. (v) Electric flux passing through a large surface is given by \u03c6 = \u03c6 = \u22c5 = \u222b \u222b \u222b d d E dS E S cos \u03b8 \u2026(ii) This is basically surface integral of electric flux over the given surface. But normally we do not study surface integral in detail in physics. Here, are two special cases for calculating the electric flux passing through a surface S of finite size (whether closed or open) Case 1 \u03c6 = ES If at every point on the surface, the magnitude of electric field is constant and perpendicular (to the surface). 154 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism E d E dS \u03c6 = E d\u03c6 = 0 Fig. 24.52 E S F E E E E E E 90\u00b0 90\u00b0 90\u00b0 90\u00b0 90\u00b0 90\u00b0 Closed surface Fig. 24.53 \u03b8 dS E Fig. 24.51  Case 2 \u03c6 = 0 If at all points on the surface the electric field is tangential to the surface. Gauss\u2019s Law This law gives a relation between the net electric flux through a closed surface and the charge enclosed by the surface. According to this law, \u201cthe net electric flux through any closed surface is equal to the net charge inside the surface divided by \u03b5 0.\u201d In symbols, it can be written as \u03c6 = \u22c5 = \u222b e S d q E S in \u03b5 0 \u2026(i) where, qin represents the net charge inside the closed surface and Erepresents the electric field at any point on the surface. In principle, Gauss\u2019s law is valid for the electric field of any system of charges or continuous distribution of charge. In practice however, the technique is useful for calculating the electric field only in situations where the degree of symmetry is high. Gauss\u2019s law can be used to evaluate the electric field for charge distributions that have spherical, cylindrical or plane symmetry. Simplified Form of Gauss's Theorem Gauss\u2019s law in simplified form can be written as under ",

If a resultant electric field exists in the conductor these free charges will experience a force which will set a current flow. When no current flows, the resultant force and the electric field must be zero. Thus, under electrostatic conditions the value of E at all points within a conductor is zero. This idea, together with the Gauss\u2019s law can be used to prove several interesting facts regarding a conductor. Excess Charge on a Conductor Resides on its Outer Surface Consider a charged conductor carrying a charge q and no currents are flowing in it. Now, consider a Gaussian surface inside the conductor everywhere on which E = 0. Thus, from Gauss\u2019s law, E S S d q \u222b \u22c5 = in \u03b5 0 We get, qin = 0, as E = 0 Thus, the sum of all charges inside the Gaussian surface is zero. This surface can be taken just inside the surface of the conductor, hence, any charge on the conductor must be on the surface of the conductor. In other words, \u201cUnder electrostatic conditions, the excess charge on a conductor resides on its outer surface.\u201d Electric Field at Any Point Close to the Charged Conductor is \u03c3 \u03b50 Consider a charged conductor of irregular shape. In general, surface charge density will vary from point to point. At a small surface \u2206S, let us assume it to be a constant \u03c3. Let us construct a Gaussian surface in the form of a cylinder of cross-section \u2206S. One plane face of the cylinder is inside the conductor and other outside the conductor close to it. The surface inside the conductor does not contribute to the flux as E is zero everywhere inside the conductor. The curved surface outside the conductor also does not contribute to flux as Eis always normal to the charged conductor and hence parallel to the curved surface. Thus, the only contribution to the flux is through the plane face outside the conductor.

Hence, from Gauss\u2019s law, E S \u22c5 = \u222b d qin \u03b5 0 gives qin = 0 This concludes that a charge of \u2013 q must reside on the metal surface of the cavity so that the sum of this induced charge \u2013 q and the original charge + q within the Gaussian surface is zero. In other words, a charge q suspended inside a cavity in a conductor induces an equal and opposite charge \u2013 q on the surface of the cavity. Further as the conductor is electrically neutral a charge + q is induced on the outer surface of the conductor. As field inside the conductor is zero, the field lines coming from q cannot penetrate into the conductor. The field lines will be as shown in Fig. (b). The same line of approach can be used to show that the field inside the cavity of a conductor is zero when no charge is suspended in it. Electrostatic shielding Suppose we have a very sensitive electronic instrument that we want to protect from external electric fields that might cause wrong measurements. We surround the instrument with a conducting box or we keep the instrument inside the cavity of a conductor. By doing this charge in the conductor is so distributed that the net electric field inside the cavity becomes zero and the instrument is protected from the external fields.

From symmetry, the magnitude E of electric field has the same value at every point on the Gaussian surface and the direction of E is radial at every point on the surface.

Permittivity Permittivity or absolute permittivity is a measure of resistance that is encountered when forming an electric field in a medium. Thus, permittivity relates to a material's ability to resist an electric field (while unfortunately, the word \u201cpermit\u201d suggests the inverse quantity). The permittivity of a medium describes how much electric field (more correctly, flux) is generated per unit charge in that medium. More electric flux (per unit charge) exists in a medium with a low permittivity. Vacuum has the lowest permittivity (therefore maximum electric flux per unit charge). Any other dielectric medium has K -times (K = dielectric constant) the permittivity of vacuum. This is because, due to polarization effects electric flux per unit charge deceasesK - times ( ). K >1 2. Dielectric constant ( ) K Also known as relative permittivity of a given material is the ratio of permittivity of the material to the permittivity of vacuum. This is the factor by which the electric force between the two charges is decreased relative to vacuum. Similarly, in the chapter of capacitors we will see that it is the ratio of capacitance of a capacitor using that material as a dielectric compared to a similar capacitor that has vacuum as its dielectric. 3.

Force between two dipoles The force between two dipoles varies inversely with the fourth power of the distance between their centres or F r \u221d1 4 In the, figure, a dipole on left with dipole moment p1 interacts with the dipole on the right with dipole moment p2. We assume that the distance between them is quite large. The electric field of the dipole on the left hand side exerts a net force on the dipole on the right hand side. Let us now calculate the net force on the dipole on right hand side.

Earthing a conductor Potential of earth is often taken to be zero. If a conductor is connected to the earth, the potential of the conductor becomes equal to that of the earth, i.e. zero. If the conductor was at some other potential, charges will flow from it to the earth or from the earth to it to bring its potential to zero.

To find electric potential due to charged spherical shells Concept To find the electric potential due to a conducting sphere (or shell) we should keep in mind the following two points (i) Electric potential on the surface and at any point inside the sphere is V q R = \u22c5 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 (R = radius of sphere) (ii) Electric potential at any point outside the sphere is V q r = \u22c5 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 (r = distance of the point from the centre) For example, in the figure shown, potential at A is V q r q r q r A A A B B C C = + + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 Similarly, potential at B is V q r q r q r B A B B B C C = + + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 and potential at C is, V q r q r q r C A C B C C C = + + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 V Example 1 Three conducting spherical shells have charges q q , \u22122 and 3q as shown in figure.

Ans. Type 2. Based on the principle of generator Concept A generator is an instrument for producing high voltages in the million volt region. Its design is based on the principle that if a charged conductor (say A) is brought into contact with a hollow conductor (say B), all of its charge transfers to the hollow conductor no matter how high the potential of the later may be. This can be shown as under: In the figure, V q r q r A A A B B = \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 \u2013 and V q r q r B A B B B = \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 \u2013 Chapter 24 Electrostatics \u0097 171 r 3r q S B qA qB rA rB A  \u2234 V V q r r A B A A B \u2013 \u2013 = \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 4 1 1 0 \u03c0\u03b5 From this expression the following conclusions can be drawn : (i) The potential difference (PD) depends on qA only. It does not depend on qB. (ii) If qA is positive, thenV V A B \u2013 is positive (asr r A B < ), i.e.V V A B > . So if the two spheres are connected by a conducting wire charge flows from inner sphere to outer sphere (positive charge flows from higher potential to lower potential) till V V A B = or V V A B \u2013 = 0. But potential difference will become zero only when qA = 0, i.e. all charge qA flows from inner sphere to outer sphere. (iii) If qA is negative, V V A B \u2013 is negative, i.e. V V A B < . Hence, when the two spheres are connected by a thin wire all charge qA will flow from inner sphere to the outer sphere. Because negative charge flows from lower potential to higher potential. Thus, we see that the whole charge qA flows from inner sphere to the outer sphere, no matter how high qB is. Charge always flows from A to B, whether q q A B > or q q B A > , V V A B > or V V B A > . V Example 3 Initially the spheres A and B are at potentials VA and VB . Find the potential of A when sphere B is earthed. Solution As we have studied above that the potential difference between these two spheres depends on the charge on the inner sphere only. Hence, the PD will remain unchanged because by earthing the sphere B charge on A remains constant. Let VA\u2032 be the new potential at A. Then, V V V V A B A B \u2013 \u2013 = \u2032 \u2032 but VB\u2032 = 0 as it is earthed. Hence, V V V A A B \u2032 = \u2013 Ans. Type 3. Based on the charges appearing on different surfaces of concentric spherical shells Concept Figure shows three concentric thin spherical shells A, B and C of radii a, b and c. The shells A and C are given charges q1 and q2 and the shell B is earthed. We are interested in finding 172 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism B qA qB A B A S  the charges on inner and outer surfaces of A, B and C. To solve such type of problems we should keep the following points in mind : (i) The whole charge q1 will come on the outer surface of A unless some charge is kept inside A. To understand it let us consider a Gaussian surface (a sphere) through the material of A. As the electric field in a conducting material is zero. The flux through this Gaussian surface is zero. Using Gauss\u2019s law, the total charge enclosed must be zero. (ii) Similarly, if we draw a Gaussian surface through the material of B we can see that q q 3 1 0 + = or q q 3 1 = \u2013 and if we draw a Gaussian surface through the material of C, then q q q q 5 4 3 1 0 + + + = or q q 5 4 = \u2013 (iii) q q q 5 6 2 + = .As q2 charge was given to shell C. (iv) Potential of B should be zero, as it is earthed. Thus, VB = 0 or 1 4 0 0 1 3 4 5 6 \u03c0\u03b5 q b q q b q q c + + + + \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa= So, using the above conditions we can find charges on different surfaces. We can summarise the above points as under 1. Net charge inside a closed Gaussian surface drawn in any shell is zero. (provided the shell is conducting). 2. Potential of the conductor which is earthed is zero. 3. If two conductors are connected, they are at same potential. 4. Charge remains constant in all conductors except those which are earthed. 5. Charge on the inner surface of the innermost shell is zero provided no charge is kept inside it. In all other shells charge resides on both the surfaces. 6. Equal and opposite charges appear on opposite faces.

It is covered by a concentric hollow conducting sphere of radius 2R. Find the charges on inner and outer surfaces of hollow sphere if it is earthed. Solution The charge on the inner surface of the hollow sphere should be \u2013q, because if we draw a closed Gaussian surface through the material of the hollow sphere the total charge enclosed by this Gaussian surface should be zero. Let q\u2032 be the charge on the outer surface of the hollow sphere. Since, the hollow sphere is earthed, its potential should be zero. The potential on it is due to the charges q q , \u2013 and q\u2032, Hence, V q R q R q R = + \u2032 \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa= 1 4 2 2 2 0 0 \u03c0\u03b5 \u2013 \u2234 q\u2032 = 0 Ans. Therefore, there will be no charge on the outer surface of the hollow sphere. V Example 5 Solve the above problem if thickness of the hollow sphere is considerable. Solution In this case, we can set V = 0 at any point on the hollow sphere. Let us select a point P a distance r from the centre, were R r R 2 3 < < .

V Example 6 Figure shows three concentric thin spherical shells A, B and C of radii R, 2R and 3R. The shell B is earthed and A and C are given charges q and 2q, respectively.

Due to a point charge, its direction is away from the charge and due to negative charge it is towards the charge. Along one dimension if one direction is taken as positive direction then the other direction is taken as the negative direction. (iv) V is a scalar quantity. On both sides of a positive charge it is positive and it is negative due to negative charge. (v) Between zero and zero value, normally we get either a maximum or minimum value.

Near + q, electric field of + q will dominate. So, net value will be negative. At some point say P both positive and negative values are equal. So, E p = 0. Beyond this point, electric field due to \u22122q will dominate due to its higher magnitude. So, net value will be positive. E p = 0 and E\u221d(towards left) is also zero. Between zero and zero we will get a maximum positive value. In region II E due to +q and due to \u22122q is towards right (so positive). Between the value +\u221d and +\u221dthe graph is as shown in figure. In region III E due to + q is towards right (so positive) and E due to \u22122q is towards left (so negative). But electric field of \u22122q will dominate due to its higher magnitude and lesser distance. Hence, net electric field is always negative. V r - graph The logics developed in E r - graph can also be applied here with V r - graph. At point P, positive potential due to + q is equal to negative potential due to \u22122q. Hence, V p = 0, so this point is near 2q. Same is the case at M. Type 7.

(ii) Acceleration of the particle is therefore, a F m qE m = = This acceleration is constant. So, path is therefore either a straight line or parabola. If initial velocity is zero or parallel to acceleration or antiparallel to acceleration, then path is straight line. Otherwise in all other cases, path is a parabola.

But net torque is zero for \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 or 180\u00b0. Here, \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 is the stable equilibrium position and \u03b8 = \u00b0 180 is unstable equilibrium position. If the dipole is released from any angle other than 0\u00b0 or180\u00b0, it rotates towards 0\u00b0. In this process electrostatic potential energy of the dipole decreases. But rotational kinetic energy increases.

An electron is placed on the ring\u2019s axis a distance 25.0 cm from the centre of the ring and is constrained to stay on the axis of the ring. The electron is then released from rest. (a) describe the subsequent motion of the electron. (b) find the speed of the electron when it reaches the centre of the ring. Solution (a) The electron will be attracted towards the centre C of the ring. At C net force is zero, but on reaching C, electron has some kinetic energy and due to inertia it crosses C, but on the other side it is further attracted towards C. Hence, motion of electron is oscillatory about point C. (b) As the electron approaches C, its speed (hence, kinetic energy) increases due to force of attraction towards the centre C. This increase in kinetic energy is at the cost of electrostatic potential energy.

(b) If both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion. (c) If Assertion is true, but the Reason is false. (d) If Assertion is false but the Reason is true. 1. Assertion : An independent negative charge moves itself from point A to point B. Then, potential at A should be less than potential at B. Reason : While moving from A to B kinetic energy of electron will increase. 2. Assertion : When two unlike charges are brought nearer, their electrostatic potential energy decreases. Reason : All conservative forces act in the direction of decreasing potential energy. 3. Assertion : At a point electric potential is decreasing along x-axis at a rate of 10 V/m. Therefore, x-component of electric field at this point should be 10 V/m along x-axis. Reason : Magnitude of E V x x = \u2202 \u2202 4. Assertion : Electric potential on the surface of a charged sphere of radius R is V . Then electric field at a distance r R = 2 from centre is V R 2 . Charge is distributed uniformly over the volume. Reason : From centre to surface, electric field varies linearly with r. Here, r is distance from centre. 5. Assertion : Gauss\u2019s theorem can be applied only for a closed surface. Reason : Electric flux can be obtained passing from an open surface also. 6. Assertion : In the electric field E = + ( $ $) / 4 4 i j N C, electric potential at A( , ) 4 0 m is more than the electric potential at B( , ) 0 4 m . Reason : Electric lines of forces always travel from higher potential to lower potential. 7. Assertion : Two charges \u2212q each are fixed at points A B and . When a third charge \u2212q is moved from A to B, electrical potential energy first decreases than increases. Reason : Along the line joining A B and , the third charge is in stable equilibrium position at centre. Exercises \u2013 q \u2013 q A B  8. Assertion : A small electric dipole is moved translationally from higher potential to lower potential in uniform electric field. Work done by electric field is positive. Reason : When a positive charge is moved from higher potential to lower potential, work done by electric field is positive. 9. Assertion : In case of charged spherical shells, E-r graph is discontinuous while V -r graph is continuous. Reason : According to Gauss\u2019s theorem only the charge inside a closed surface can produce electric field at some point. 10. Assertion : If we see along the axis of a charged ring, the magnitude of electric field is minimum at centre and magnitude of electric potential is maximum.

A practical way to handle a charge would be to put it on a conductor. Thus, one use of a conductor is to store electric charge (or electric potential energy). But, every conductor has its maximum limit of storing the electric charge or potential energy. Beyond that limit, the dielectric in which the conductor is placed, becomes ionized. A capacitor is a device which can store more electric charge or potential energy compared to an isolated conductor. Capacitors have a tremendous number of applications. In the flash light used by photographers, the energy and charge stored in a capacitor are recovered quickly. In other applications, the energy is released more slowly. Capacitance of an Isolated Conductor When a charge q is given to a conductor, it spreads over the outer surface of the conductor. The whole conductor comes to the same potential (say V ). This potential V is directly proportional to the charge q, i.e. V q \u221d When the proportionality sign is removed, a constant of proportionality 1 C comes in picture. Hence, V q C = or C q V = Here, C is called the capacitance of the conductor. The SI unit of capacitance is called one farad (1F). One farad is equal to one coulomb per volt ( ) 1C /V \u2234 1F 1farad 1C/V 1 coulomb volt = = = / Note (i) An obvious question arises in mind that when a conductor stores electric charge and energy then why not the unit of capacitance is coulomb or joule. For example, the capacity of a storage tank is given in litres (the unit of volume) or gallons not in the name of some scientist. The reason is simple the capacity of tank does not depend on medium in which it is kept. While the capacity of a conductor to store charge (or energy) depends on the medium in which it is kept. It varies from medium to medium. So, it is difficult to express the capacity in terms of coulomb or joule. Because in that case we will have to mention the medium also. For example, we will say like this, capacity of this conductor in water is 1 C in oil it is5 C, etc. On the other hand, the C discussed above gives us an idea about the dimensions of the conductor nothing about the charge which it can store because as we said earlier also it will vary from medium to medium. By knowing the C (or the dimensions of conductor) a physics student can easily find the maximum charge which it can store, provided the medium is also given. (ii) Farad in itself is a large unit. Microfarad ( ) \u00b5F is used more frequently. Method of Finding Capacitance of a Conductor Give a charge q to the conductor. Find potential on it due to charge q. This potential V will be a function of q and finally find q /V, which is the desired capacitance C. 234 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism V + + + + + + + + + + + + + + + q Fig. 25.1  Capacitance of a Spherical Conductor When a charge q is given to a spherical conductor of radius R, the potential on it is V q R = \u22c5 1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 From this expression, we find that q V R C = = 4\u03c0\u03b5 0 Thus, capacitance of the spherical conductor is C R = 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5 From this expression, we can draw the following conclusions : (i) C R \u221d or C depends on R only. Which we have already stated that C depends on the dimensions of the conductor. Moreover if two conductors have radii R1 and R2, then C C R R 1 2 1 2 = (ii) Earth is also a spherical conductor of radius R = \u00d7 6.4 m 106 . The capacity of earth is therefore, C = \u00d7 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7\uf8f7 \u00d7 1 9 10 10 9 6 ( ) 6.4 \u2248 \u00d7 711 10 6 \u2013 F or C = 711\u00b5F From here, we can see that farad is a large unit. As capacity of such a huge conductor is only F 711\u00b5 . \u0098 Dielectric strength of an insulator In an insulator, most of the electrons are tightly bounded with the nucleus. If an electric field is applied on this insulator, an electrostatic force acts on these electrons in the opposite direction of electric field. As electric field increases, this force also increases. After a certain value of electric field, force becomes so large that these bounded electrons are knocked out or ionized. This maximum electric field is called dielectric strength of insulator. Its unit is N/C or V/m. \u0098 With the help of capacitance (or dimensions of conductor) and dielectric strength of an insulator we can determine the maximum charge or energy which can be stored by this conductor.

These are joined through a valve which was initially closed. When the valve is opened, the level in both the vessels becomes equal but the volume of liquid in the right side vessel is more than the liquid in the left side vessel. This is because the base area (or capacity) of this vessel is more. Now, suppose two conductors of capacitiesC1 andC2 have charges q1 and q2 respectively when they are joined together by a conducting wire, charge redistributes in these conductors in the ratio of their capacities.

Find (a) their common potential (b) the final charges on them (c) the loss of energy during redistribution of charges. 25.3 Capacitors Any two conductors separated by an insulator (or a vacuum) form a capacitor. In most practical applications, each conductor initially has zero net charge, and electrons are transferred from one conductor to the other. This is called charging of the conductor. Then, the two conductors have charges with equal magnitude and opposite sign, and the net charge on the capacitor as a whole remains zero. When we say that a capacitor has charge q we mean that the conductor at higher potential has charge + q and the conductor at lower potential has charge \u2013 q. In circuit diagram, a capacitor is represented by two parallel lines as shown in Fig. 25.7. One common way to charge a capacitor is to connect the two conductors to opposite terminals of a battery. This gives a fixed potential differenceVab between the conductors, which is just equal to the voltage of the battery. The ratio q Vab is called the capacitance of the capacitor. Hence, C q Vab = (capacitance of a capacitor) Chapter 25 Capacitors \u0097 241 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 25.1 +q a b \u2013q Fig. 25.6 Fig. 25.7  Calculation of Capacitance Give a charge + q to one plate and \u2212q to the other plate. Then, find potential differenceV between the plates. Now, C q V = Parallel Plate Capacitor Two metallic parallel plates of any shape but of same size and separated by a small distance constitute parallel plate capacitor. Suppose the area of each plate is A and the separation between the two plates is d. Also assume that the space between the plates contains vacuum. We put a charge q on one plate and a charge \u2013 q on the other. This can be done either by connecting one plate with the positive terminal and the other with negative plate of a battery [as shown in Fig. (a)] or by connecting one plate to the earth and by giving a charge + q to the other plate only. This charge will induce a charge \u2013 q on the earthed plate. The charges will appear on the facing surfaces. The charge density on each of these surfaces has a magnitude \u03c3 = q A / . If the plates are large as compared to the separation between them, then the electric field between the plates (at point B) is uniform and perpendicular to the plates except for a small region near the edge. The magnitude of this uniform field E may be calculated by using the fact that both positive and negative plates produce the electric field in the same direction (from positive plate towards negative plate) of magnitude \u03c3/ \u03b5 2 0 and therefore, the net electric field between the plates will be E = + = \u03c3 \u03b5 \u03c3 \u03b5 \u03c3 \u03b5 2 2 0 0 0 242 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism (a) (b) or +q \u2013q +++++++ +++ \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 q +++++++ +++ \u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013\u2013 \u2013q Fig. 25.8 + + + + + + + + + + + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 +\u03c3 \u2013 \u03c3 P Q A C B E = 0 E = 0 E = \u03c3 \u03b5 2 0 + \u03c3 \u03b5 2 0 = \u03c3 \u03b50 d Fig. 25.9  Outside the plates (at points A and C) the field due to positive sheet of charge and negative sheet of charge are in opposite directions. Therefore, net field at these points is zero.

Effect of Dielectrics Most capacitors have a dielectric between their conducting plates. Placing a solid dielectric between the plates of a capacitor serves the following three functions : (i) It solves the problem of maintaining two large metal sheets at a very small separation without actual contact. (ii) It increases the maximum possible potential difference which can be applied between the plates of the capacitor without the dielectric breakdown. Many dielectric materials can tolerate stronger electric fields without breakdown than can air. (iii) It increases the capacitance of the capacitor. When a dielectric material is inserted between the plates (keeping the charge to be constant) the electric field and hence the potential difference decreases by a factor K (the dielectric constant of the dielectric). \u2234 E E K = 0 and V V K = 0 (When q is constant) Chapter 25 Capacitors \u0097 243 \u03c3 \u2013\u03c3 + + + + + + + + \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 ",

Alternatively, if the plates of the capacitor are connected to a battery, the current starts flowing in the circuit. Thus, is as much charge enters the positive plate of the capacitor, the same charge leaves the negative plate. So, we can say, the positive plate can accept infinite amount of charge or its capacitance has become infinite. Energy Stored in Charged Capacitor A charged capacitor stores an electric potential energy in it, which is equal to the work required to charge it. This energy can be recovered if the capacitor is allowed to discharge. If the charging is done by a battery, electrical energy is stored at the expense of chemical energy of battery. Suppose at time t, a charge q is present on the capacitor and V is the potential of the capacitor.

(b) What is the charge density on each surface of the dielectric? 25.4 Mechanical Force on a Charged Conductor We know that similar charges repel each other, hence the charge on any part of surface of the conductor is repelled by the charge on its remaining part. The surface of the conductor thus experiences a mechanical force. The electric field at any point P near the conductor\u2019s surface can be assumed as due to a small part of the surface of area say \u2206S immediately in the neighbourhood of the point under consideration and due to the rest of the surface. Let E1 and E2 be the field intensities due to these parts respectively. Then, total electric field, E E E = + 1 2 Ehas a magnitude \u03c3/\u03b5 0 at any point P just outside the conductor and is zero at point Q just inside the conductor.

Find charges on different capacitors. 2. Find charges on different capacitors. 25.6 Two Laws in Capacitors Like an electric circuit having resistances and batteries in a complex circuit containing capacitors and the batteries charges on different capacitors can be obtained with the help of Kirchhoff \u2019s laws. First Law This law is basically law of conservation of charge which is normally applied across a battery or in an isolated system. (i) In case of a battery, both terminals of the battery supply equal amount of charge. (ii) In an isolated system (not connected to any source of charge like terminal of a battery or earth) net charge remains constant. For example, in the Fig. 25.31, the positive terminal of the battery supplies a positive charge q q 1 2 + . Similarly, the negative terminal supplies a negative charge of magnitude q q 3 4 + .

The i-t graph is as shown in Fig. 25.43. Here, i V R 0 = is the current at time t = 0. This is the current which would had been in the absence of capacitor in the circuit. Discharging of a Capacitor in C-R Circuit To understand discharging through a C-R circuit again we first consider the discharging without resistance. Suppose a capacitor has a charge q0. The positive plate has a charge + q0 and negative plate \u2013 q0. It implies that the positive plate has deficiency of electrons and negative plate has excess of electrons. When the switch is closed, the extra electrons on negative plate immediately rush to the positive plate and net charge on both plates becomes zero. So, we can say that discharging takes place immediately. In case of a C-R circuit, discharging also takes time. Final charge on the capacitor is still zero but after sufficiently long period of time. The q-t equation in this case is v q q e t C = 0 \u2013 /\u03c4 Thus, q decreases exponentially from q0 to zero, as shown in Fig. 25.46. From the graph and the equation, we see that At t q q = = 0 0 , At t q = \u221e = , 0. Definition of Time Constant ( ) \u03c4C In case of discharging, definition of \u03c4C is changed. At time t C = \u03c4 , q q e q = = 0 1 0 \u2013 0.368 Hence, in this case \u03c4C can be defined as the time when charge reduces to 36.8% of its maximum value q0.

Thus, i-t graph decreases exponentially with time from i0 to 0. The i-t graph is as shown in Fig. 25.47. 25.9 Methods of Finding Equivalent Resistance and Capacitance We know that in series, R R R Rn eq = + +\u2026 + 1 2 and 1 1 1 1 1 2 C C C Cn eq = + +\u2026 + and in parallel, 1 1 1 1 1 2 R R R Rn eq = + +\u2026 + and C C C Cn eq = + +\u2026 + 1 2 Sometimes there are circuits in which resistances/capacitors are in mixed grouping.

Method of Same Potential Give any arbitrary potentials (V V 1 2 , , . \u2026etc) to all terminals of capacitors/resistors. But notice that the points connected directly by a conducting wire will have at the same potential. The capacitors/resistors having the same PD are in parallel.

For example, In Fig. (a), AB is not a line of symmetry but, 1, 2 and 3 are line of symmetry. Hence, they are at same potential (if A and B are connected to a battery).

The equivalent resistance between A and B can now be easily determined as 5 4 r \u22c5 4. Each wire in the cube has a resistance r. We are interested in calculating the equivalent resistance between A and B. This is a three-dimensional case and in place of a line of symmetry involving points A and B we locate a plane of symmetry involving A and B. Such a plane is the plane ABce and for this plane points d and f and g and h have the same potential. The equivalent resistance between A and B can now be easily worked out (Using Wheatstone\u2019s bridge principle) as R r eq = 3 4 Connection Removal Method This method is useful when the circuit diagram is symmetric except for the fact that the input and output are reversed. That is the flow of current is a mirror image between input and output above a particular axis. In such cases, some junctions are unnecessarily made. Even if we remove that junction there is no difference in the remaining circuit or current distribution. But after removing the junction, the problem becomes very simple. The following example illustrates the theory. V Example 25.17 Find the equivalent resistance between points A and B.

Leakage Current Through a Capacitor The space between the capacitor\u2019s plates is filled with a dielectric and we assume that no current flows through it when the capacitor is connected to a battery as in figure (a) or if the capacitor is charged, the charge on its plates remains forever. But every insulator has some conductivity. On account of which some current flows through the capacitor if connected to a battery. This small current is known as the leakage current. Similarly, when it is charged, the charge does not remain as it is for a long period of time. But it starts discharging. Or we can say it becomes a case of discharging of a capacitor in C-R circuit. In both the cases, we will first find the resistance of the dielectric. R l A = \u03c3 ( ) \u03c3 = specific conductance Here, l d = (the distance between the plates of the capacitor) \u2234 R d A = \u03c3 Thus, the leakage current in the circuit shown in the figure is i V R = Chapter 25 Capacitors \u0097 273 i i R = d A \u03c3 V x t x2 x1 x t x1 x2 x x 1 2 \u2013 or + \u2013 q0 (a) (b)  Similarly, if the capacitor is given a chargeq0 at timet = 0, then after time t, q charge will remain on it, where q q e t C = 0 \u2013 /\u03c4 (Discharging of a capacitor) Here, \u03c4C ",

If capacitors are in series, then charges on them are equal, provided they are initially uncharged.

So, net charge on them will remain constant. \u03a3 \u03a3 q q f i = If initially they are uncharged, then \u03a3qi = 0 \u03a3qf is also zero or \u2212 + = q q 1 2 0 or q q 1 2 = So, this proves that charges are equal if initially they are uncharged. 5.

Configuration of capacitor is changed and change in five quantities q, C, V, U and E is asked Concept Some problems are asked when a capacitor is charged through a battery and then the configuration of capacitor is changed : (i) either by inserting a dielectric slab or removing the slab (if it already exists) or (ii) by changing the distance between the plates of capacitor or (iii) by both. The questions will be based on the change in electric field, potential, etc. In such problems, two cases are possible. Case 1 When battery is removed after charging If the battery is removed after charging, then the charge stored in the capacitor remains constant. q = constant First of all, find the change in capacitance and according to the formula find the change in other quantities.

Based on heat generation or loss of energy during shifting of switch Concept By heat generation (or loss of energy), we mean that when a switch is shifted from one position to the other, what amount of heat will be generated (or loss will be there) in the circuit. Such problems can be solved by simple energy conservation principle. For this, remember that when a charge + q flows from negative terminal to the positive terminal inside a battery of emf V is supplied an energy, E qV = 280 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism 30 V \u2013 \u2013 + 60 V + \u2013 \u2013 + 48 C \u00b5 48 C \u00b5 120 C \u00b5 72 C \u00b5 48 C \u00b5 72 C \u00b5 72 C \u00b5 2 F \u00b5 3 F \u00b5 + V q Energy supplied = qV Energy consumed = qV + V q  and if opposite is the case, i.e. charge + q flows in opposite direction, then it consumes energy by the same amount. Now, from energy conservation principle we can find the heat generated (or loss of energy) in the circuit in shifting the switch. Heat generated or loss of energy = energy supplied by the battery/batteries \u2013 energy consumed by the battery/batteries + \u03a3 \u03a3 U U i f \u2013 .

To find final charges on different capacitors when position of switch is changed (opened, closed or shifted from one position to other position) Concept (i) To find current in a C R - circuit at any time t, a capacitor may be assumed a battery of emf E or V q C = . (ii) Difference between a normal battery and a capacitor battery is, emf of a normal battery remains constant while emf of a capacitor battery keeps on changing with q. (iii) Before changing the position of switch, every loop of the circuit may not be balanced by Kirchhoff's second equation of potential. So, in a single loop problem rotate a charge q, either clockwise or anti-clockwise. From this charge q, some of the charges on capacitors may increase and others may decrease. To check this, always concentrate on positive plate of each capacitors. If positive charge comes towards this plate, then charge on this capacitor will increase. (iv) With these charges, apply Kirchhoff's loop equation and find the final charges on them. (v) In this redistribution of charges, there is some loss of energy as discussed in type 5. (vi) If there are only capacitors in the circuit, then redistribution of charges is immediate and if there are resistors in the circuit, then redistribution is exponential. (vii) If there are only capacitors, then loss is in the form of electromagnetic waves and if there are resistors in the circuit, then loss is in the form of heat. Further, this loss is proportional to R if resistors are in series(H i Rt = 2 or H R \u221d as i is same in series) and this loss is inversely proportional to R if resistors are in parallel (H V t R = 2 or H R \u221d1 as V is same in parallel).

So, we can assume that +q charge rotates anti-clockwise in the loop (between time t = 0 and t = \u221e). After this rotation of charges, final charges on different capacitors are as shown below.

Shortcut method of finding time varying functions in a C-R circuit like q or i etc. Concept (i) At time t = 0, when capacitor is uncharged it offers maximum current passing through it. So, it may be assumed like a conducting wire of zero resistance. With this concept, find initial values of q or i etc. (ii) At time t = \u221e, when capacitor is fully charged it does not allow current through it, as insulator is filled between the plates. So, its resistance may be assumed as infinite. With this concept, find steady state values at time t = \u221eof q or i etc. (iii) Equivalent time constant To find the equivalent time constant of a circuit, the following steps are followed : (a) Short-circuit the battery. (b) Find net resistance across the capacitor (suppose it is Rnet) (c) \u03c4C R C = ( ) net (iv) In C R - circuit, increase or decrease is always exponential. So, first make exponential graph and then write exponential equation corresponding to this graph with the time constant obtained by the method discussed above. V Example 10 Switch S is closed at time t = 0 in the circuit shown in figure. (a) Find the time varying quantities in the circuit. (b) Find their values at time t = 0. (c) Find their values at time t = \u221e (d) Find time constant of all time varying functions. (e) Make their exponential graphs and write their exponential equations. (f) Just write the equations to solve them to find different time varying functions. Solution (a) There are four times variable functions i i i 1 2 3 , , and q. (b) At t = 0, equivalent resistance of capacitor is zero.

The word magnet comes from ancient Greek place name Magnesia (the modern town Manisa in Western Turkey), where the natural magnets called lodestones were found. The fundamental nature of magnetism is the interaction of moving electric charges. Unlike electric forces which act on electric charges whether they are moving or not, magnetic forces act only on moving charges and current carrying wires. We will describe magnetic forces using the concept of a field. A magnetic field is established by a permanent magnet, by an electric current or by other moving charges. This magnetic field, in turn, exerts forces on other moving charges and current carrying conductors. In this chapter, first we study the magnetic forces and torques exerted on moving charges and currents by magnetic fields, then we will see how to calculate the magnetic fields produced by currents and moving charges. 26.2 Magnetic Force on a Moving Charge ( ) Fm An unknown electric field can be determined by magnitude and direction of the force on a test charge q0 at rest. To explore an unknown magnetic field (denoted by B), we must measure the magnitude and direction of the force on a moving test charge. The magnetic force ( ) Fm on a charge q moving with velocity v in a magnetic field Bis given, both in magnitude and direction, by F v B m q = \u00d7 ( ) \u2026(i) Following points are worthnoting regarding the above expression. (i) The magnitude of Fm is F Bqv m = sin \u03b8 where, \u03b8 is the angle between v and B. (ii) Fm is zero when, (a) B = 0, i.e. no magnetic field is present. (b) q = 0, i.e. particle is neutral. (c) v = 0, i.e. charged particle is at rest or (d) \u03b8 = \u00b0 \u00b0 0 180 or , i.e. v B \u2191\u2191 or v B \u2191\u2193 (iii) Fm is maximum at \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 and this maximum value is Bqv. (iv) The units of Bmust be the same as the units of F qv. Therefore, the SI unit of B is equivalent to N-s C-m. This unit is called the tesla (abbreviated as T), in honour of Nikola Tesla, the prominent Serbian-American scientist and inventor. Thus, 1 tesla = 1T = 1N-s C-m 1N A-m = The CGS unit of B, the gauss ( ) \u2013 1 10 4 G T = is also in common use. (v) In equation number (i) q is to be substituted with sign. If q is positive, magnetic force is along v B \u00d7 and if q is negative, magnetic force is in a direction opposite to v B \u00d7 . 336 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism  (vi) Direction of Fm From the property of cross product we can infer that Fm is perpendicular to both v and Bor it is perpendicular to the plane formed by v and B. The exact direction of Fm can be given by any of the following methods: (a) Direction of Fm = (sign of q) (direction of v B \u00d7 ) or, as we stated earlier also, F v B m \u2191\u2191 \u00d7 if q is positive and F v B m \u2191\u2193 \u00d7 if q is negative. (b) Fleming's left hand rule According to this rule, the forefinger, the central finger and the thumb of the left hand are stretched in such a way that they are mutually perpendicular to each other. If the central finger shows the direction of velocity of positive charge ( ) v +q and forefinger shows the direction of magnetic field ( ) B , then the thumb will give the direction of magnetic force ( ) Fm . If instead of positive charge we have the negative charge, then Fm is in opposite direction. (c) Right hand rule Wrap the fingers of your right hand around the line perpendicular to the plane of v and Bas shown in figure, so that they curl around with the sense of rotation from v to Bthrough the smaller angle between them. Your thumb then points in the direction of the force Fm on a positive charge. (Alternatively, the direction of the force Fm on a positive charge is the direction in which a right hand thread screw would advance if turned the same way). (vii) F v m \u22a5 or F s m d dt \u22a5 . Therefore, F s m d \u22a5 or the work done by the magnetic force in a static magnetic field is zero. W m F = 0 So, from work energy theorem KE and hence the speed of the charged particle remains constant in magnetic field. The magnetic force can change the direction only. It cannot increase or decrease the speed or kinetic energy of the particle.

Find the speed of the electron. 7. He2+ ion travels at right angles to a magnetic field of 0.80 T with a velocity of 105 m/s. Find the magnitude of the magnetic force on the ion. Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 339 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 26.1  26.3 Path of a Charged Particle in Uniform Magnetic Field The path of a charged particle in uniform magnetic field depends on the angle \u03b8 (the angle between v and B ). Depending on the different values of \u03b8, the following three cases are possible. Case 1 When \u03b8 is 0\u00b0 or 180\u00b0 As we have seen in Art. 26.2, Fm = 0, when\u03b8 is either0\u00b0 or180\u00b0. Hence, path of the charged particle is a straight line (undeviated) when it enters parallel or antiparallel to magnetic field. Case 2 When \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 When \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 , the magnetic force is F Bqv Bqv m = \u00b0 = sin90 . This magnetic force is perpendicular to the velocity at every instant. Hence, path is a circle. The necessary centripetal force is provided by the magnetic force. Hence, if r be the radius of the circle, then mv r Bqv 2 = or r mv Bq = This expression of r can be written in the following different ways r mv Bq p Bq Km Bq qVm Bq = = = = 2 2 Here, p = momentum of particle K =KE of particle = p m 2 2 or p Km = 2 We also know that if the charged particle is accelerated by a potential difference of V volts, it acquires a KE given by K qV = Further, time period of the circular path will be T r v mv Bq v m Bq = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = 2 2 2 \u03c0 \u03c0 \u03c0 or T m Bq = 2\u03c0 340 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism B B Fm = 0 or q q v v +\u2013 +\u2013 Fig. 26.4  or   The angular speed ( ) \u03c9 of the particle is \u03c9 \u03c0 = = 2 T Bq m \u2234 \u03c9 = Bq m Frequency of rotation is f T = 1 or f Bq m = 2\u03c0 The following points are worthnoting regarding a circular path: (i) The plane of the circle is perpendicular to magnetic field. If the magnetic field is along z-direction, the circular path is in x-y plane. The speed of the particle does not change in magnetic field. Hence, if v0 be the speed of the particle, then velocity of particle at any instant of time will be v i j = + v v x y $ $ where, v v v x y 2 2 0 2 + = (ii) T f , and \u03c9 are independent of v while the radius is directly proportional to v. Hence, if two charged particles of equal mass and charge enter in a magnetic field B with different speeds v1 and v v 2 1 ( ) > at right angles, then T T 1 2 = but r r 2 1 > as shown in figure. Note Charge per unit mass q m is known as specific charge. It is sometimes denoted by \u03b1. So, in terms of \u03b1, the above formulae can be written as r v B = \u03b1 , T B = 2\u03c0 \u03b1 , f B = \u03b1 \u03c0 2 and \u03c9 \u03b1 = B Case 3 When \u03b8 is other than 0 180 \u00b0 \u00b0 , or 90\u00b0 In this case velocity can be resolved into two components, one along Band another perpendicular to B. Let the two components be v| | and v\u22a5.

The resultant path is a helix as shown in figure. The radius of this helical path is r mv Bq mv Bq = = \u22a5 sin\u03b8 Time period and frequency do not depend on velocity and so they are given by T m Bq = 2\u03c0 and f Bq m = 2\u03c0 There is one more term associated with a helical path, that is pitch (p) of the helical path. Pitch is defined as the distance travelled along magnetic field in one complete cycle. i.e. p v T = | | or p v m Bq = ( cos ) \u03b8 \u03c0 2 \u2234 p mv Bq = 2\u03c0 \u03b8 cos V Example 26.4 Two particles A and B of masses mA and mB respectively and having the same charge are moving in a plane. A uniform magnetic field exists perpendicular to this plane. The speeds of the particles are vA and vB respectively and the trajectories are as shown in the figure.

Repeat this problem for a proton. 26.4 Magnetic Force on a Current Carrying Conductor A charged particle in motion experiences a magnetic force in a magnetic field. Similarly, a current carrying wire also experiences a force when placed in a magnetic field. This follows from the fact that the current is a collection of many charged particles in motion. Hence, the resultant force exerted by the field on the wire is the vector sum of the individual forces exerted on all the charged particles making up the current. The force exerted on the particles is transmitted to the wire when the particles collide with the atoms making up the wire. 344 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism D C B A Fig. 26.9 A l vd Fm \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 i B Fig. 26.10 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 26.2  Suppose a conducting wire carrying a current i is placed in a magnetic field B. The length of the wire is l and area of cross-section is A. The free electrons drift with a speed vd opposite to the direction of current. The magnetic force exerted on the electron is d e m d F v B = \u00d7 \u2013 ( ) If n be the number of free electrons per unit volume of the wire, then total number of electrons in volume Al of the wire are, nAl. Therefore, total force on the wire is F v B m d e = \u00d7 \u2013 ( ) ( ) nAl If we denote the length l along the direction of the current by l, then the above equation becomes F l B m i = \u00d7 ( ) \u2026(i) where, neAv i d = The following points are worthnoting regarding the above expression : (i) Magnitude of Fm is, F ilB m = sin\u03b8, here \u03b8 is the angle between l and B. Fm is zero for \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 or 180\u00b0 and maximum for \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 . (ii) Here, l is a vector that points in the direction of the current i and has a magnitude equal to the length. (iii) The above expression applies only to a straight segment of wire in a uniform magnetic field. (iv) For the magnetic force on an arbitrarily shaped wire segment, let us consider the magnetic force exerted on a small segment of vector length dl. d i d m F l B = \u00d7 ( ) \u2026(ii) To calculate the total force Fm acting on the wire shown in figure, we integrate Eq. (ii) over the length of the wire. F l B m i d = \u00d7 \u222b( ) A D \u2026(iii) Now, let us consider two special cases involving Eq. (iii). In both cases, the magnetic field is taken to be constant in magnitude and direction. Case 1 A curved wire ACD as shown in Fig. (a) carries a current i and is located in a uniform magnetic field B. Because the field is uniform, we can take Boutside the integral in Eq. (iii) and we obtain, F l B m A D i d = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u00d7 \u222b \u2026(iv) But, the quantity d A D l \u222b represents the vector sum of all length elements from A to D. From the polygon law of vector addition, the sum equals the vector l directed from A to D.

We can again express the force acting on the loop in the form of Eq. (iv), but this time we must take the vector sum of the length elements dl over the entire loop, F l B m i d = \u00d7 \u222b( ) Because the set of length elements forms a closed polygon, the vector sum must be zero. \u2234 Fm = 0 Thus, the net magnetic force acting on any closed current carrying loop in a uniform magnetic field is zero. (v) The direction of Fm can be given by Fleming's left hand rule as discussed in Art. 26.2. According to this rule, the forefinger, the central finger and the thumb of the left hand are stretched in such a way that they are mutually perpendicular to each other.

It has two poles: south ( ) S and north ( ) N . This is similar to a bar magnet. Magnetic field lines emanate from the north pole and after forming a closed path terminate on south pole. Each magnetic dipole has some magnetic moment ( ) M . The magnitude of M is | | M = NiA Here, N = number of turns in the loop i = current in the loop and A = area of cross-section of the loop. For the direction of M any one of the following methods can be used: (i) As in case of an electric dipole, the dipole moment p has a direction from negative charge to positive charge. In the similar manner, direction of M is from south to north pole. The south and north poles can be identified by the sense of current. The side from where the current seems to be clockwise becomes south pole and the opposite side from where it seems anti-clockwise becomes north pole. Now, let us find the direction and magnitude of M in the three loops shown in Fig. 26.18. Refer figure (a) In this case, current appears to be clockwise from outside the paper, so this side becomes the south pole. From the back of the paper it seems anti-clockwise. Hence, this side becomes the north pole. As the magnetic moment is from south to north pole. It is directed perpendicular to paper inwards. Further, | | M = = NiA R i \u03c0 2 Refer figure (b) Here, opposite is the case. South pole is into the paper and north pole is outside the paper. Therefore, magnetic moment is perpendicular to paper in outward direction. The magnitude of M is | | M = a i 2 Refer figure (c) In this case, south pole is on the right side of the loop and north pole on the left side. Hence, M is directed from right to left. The magnitude of magnetic moment is | | M = abi (ii) Vector M is along the normal to the plane of the loop. The orientation (up or down along the normal) is given by the right hand rule.

Then, extend your thumb so that it is perpendicular to the plane of the loop.

The following points are worthnoting regarding the torque acting on the loop in uniform magnetic field. (i) Magnitude of \u03c4 is MB sin\u03b8 or NiAB sin\u03b8. Here, \u03b8 is the angle between M and B. Torque is zero when \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 or 180\u00b0 and it is maximum at \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 . (ii) If the loop is free to rotate in a magnetic field, the axis of rotation becomes an axis parallel to \u03c4 passing through the centre of mass of the loop. The above equation for the torque is very similar to that of an electric dipole in an electric field.

To complete the description of the magnetic interaction, this and the next article deals with the origin of the magnetic field. As in electrostatics, there are two methods of calculating the electric field at some point. One is Coulomb's law which gives the electric field due to a point charge and the another is Gauss's law which is useful in calculating the electric field of a highly symmetric configuration of charge. Similarly, in magnetics, there are basically two methods of calculating magnetic field at some point. One is Biot Savart law which gives the magnetic field due to an infinitesimally small current carrying wire at some point and the another is Ampere's law, which is useful in calculating the magnetic field of a highly symmetric configuration carrying a steady current. We begin by showing how to use the law of Biot and Savart to calculate the magnetic field produced at some point in space by a small current element. Using this formalism and the principle of superposition, we then calculate the total magnetic field due to various current distributions. From their experimental results, Biot and Savart arrived at a mathematical expression that gives the magnetic field at some point in space in terms of the current that produces the field. That expression is based on the following experimental observations for the magnetic field dB at a point P associated with a length element dl of a wire carrying a steady current i. 354 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 26.4 \u03b8 r r P dl i Fig. 26.28  (i) The vector dB is perpendicular to both dl (which points in the direction of the current) and the unit vector $r directed from dl to P. (ii) The magnitude of dB is inversely proportional to r 2, where r is the distance from dl to P. (iii) The magnitude of dBis proportional to the current and to the magnitude dl of the length element dl. (iv) The magnitude of dB is proportional to sin\u03b8 where \u03b8 is the angle between dl and $r. These observations are summarized in mathematical formula known today as Biot Savart law d i d r B l r = \u00d7 \u00b5 \u03c0 0 2 4 ( $) \u2026(i) Here, \u00b5 \u03c0 0 7 4 10 = \u2013 T-m A It is important to note that dB in Eq. (i) is the field created by the current in only a small length element dl of the conductor. To find the total magnetic field Bcreated at some point by a current of finite size, we must sum up contributions from all current elements that make up the current. That is, we must evaluate B by integrating Eq. (i). B l r = \u00d7 \u222b \u00b5 \u03c0 0 2 4 i d r $ where, the integral is taken over the entire current distribution. This expression must be handled with special care because the integrand is a cross product and therefore, a vector quantity. The following points are worthnoting regarding the Biot Savart law. (i) Magnitude of dB is given by | | sin d idl r B = \u00b5 \u03c0 \u03b8 0 2 4 | | dB is zero at \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 or 180\u00b0 and maximum at \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 . (ii) For the direction of dB either of the following methods can be employed. (a) d d B l r \u2191\u2191 \u00d7 $. So, dB is along dl r \u00d7 . (b) If dl is in the plane of paper. dB = 0at all points lying on the straight line passing through dl. The magnetic field to the right of this line is in \u2297direction and to the left of this line is inu direction.

If we stretch the thumb of the right hand along the current and curl our fingers to pass through P, the direction of the fingers at P gives the direction of magnetic field there.

This means that the work done by the static electric force around any closed path is zero. q d E l \u22c5 = \u222b 0J Hence, we have E l \u22c5 = \u222b d 0 V In other words, the integral of the static (time independent) electric field around a closed path is zero. What about the integral of the magnetic field around a closed path? That is, we want to determine the value of B l \u22c5 \u222b d Here, we have to be careful. The quantity B l \u22c5d does not represent some physical quantity, and certainly not work. Although the static magnetic force does no work on a moving charge, we cannot conclude that the path integral of the magnetic field around a closed path is zero. We are just curious about what this analogous line integral amounts to. The line integral B l \u22c5 \u222b d of the resultant magnetic field along a closed, plane curve is equal to\u00b5 0 times the total current crossing the area bounded by the closed curve provided the electric field inside the loop remains constant. Thus, B l \u22c5 = \u222b d i \u00b5 0 ( ) net \u2026(i) This is known as Ampere's circuital law. Eq. (i) in simplified form can be written as Bl i = \u00b5 0 ( ) net \u2026(ii) But this equation can be used only under the following conditions. (i) At every point of the closed path B l || d . (ii) Magnetic field has the same magnitude B at all places on the closed path. If this is not the case, then Eq. (i) is written as B dl B dl i 1 1 1 2 2 2 0 cos cos ( ) \u03b8 \u03b8 \u00b5 + +\u2026 = net Here, \u03b81 is the angle between B1 and dl1 , \u03b8 2 the angle between B2 and dl 2 and so on. Besides the Biot Savart law, Ampere\u2019s law gives another method to calculate the magnetic field due to a given current distribution. Ampere\u2019s law may be derived from the Biot Savart law and Bio Savart law may be derived from the Ampere\u2019s law. However, Ampere's law is more useful under certain symmetrical conditions. To illustrate the theory now let us take few applications of Ampere\u2019s circuital law. Magnetic Field Created by a Long Current Carrying Wire A long straight wire of radius R carries a steady current i that is uniformly distributed through the cross-section of the wire. 364 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism  For finding the behaviour of magnetic field due to this wire, let us divide the whole region into two parts. One is r R \u2265 and the another is r R < . Here, r is the distance from the centre of the wire. For r R \u2265 : Let us choose for our path of integration circle 1. From symmetry Bmust be constant in magnitude and parallel to dl at every point on this circle. Because the total current passing through the plane of the circle is i. Ampere\u2019s law gives B l \u22c5 = \u222b d i \u00b5 0 net or Bl i = \u00b5 0 [simplified form] or B r i ( ) 2 0 \u03c0 \u00b5 = \u2234 B i r = \u00b5 \u03c0 0 2 [for r R \u2265 ] \u2026(iii) For r R < : Here, the current i \u2032passing through the plane of circle 2 is less than the total current i. Because the current is uniform over the cross-section of the wire, the fraction of the current enclosed by circle 2 must equal the ratio of the area \u03c0r 2 enclosed by circle 2 to the cross-sectional area \u03c0R 2 of the wire. i i r R \u2032 = \u03c0 \u03c0 2 2 \u21d2 i r R i \u2032= \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 2 2 Then, the following procedure same as for circle 1, we apply Ampere\u2019s law to circle 2. B l \u22c5 = \u222b d i \u00b5 0 net Bl i = \u2032 \u00b5 0 [simplified form] \u2234 B r r R i ( ) 2 0 2 2 \u03c0 \u00b5 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u2234 B i R r = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u00b5 \u03c0 0 2 2 [For r R < ] \u2026(iv) This result is similar in the form to the expression for the electric field inside a uniformly charged sphere. The magnitude of the magnetic field versus r for this configuration is plotted in figure. Note that inside the wire B \u21920 as r \u21920. Note also that Eqs. (iii) and (iv) give the same value of the magnetic field at r R = , demonstrating that the magnetic field is continuous at the surface of the wire.

With this configuration, a reasonably uniform magnetic field can be produced in the space surrounded by the turns of wire, which we shall call the interior of the solenoid, when the solenoid carries a current. When the turns are closely spaced, each can be approximated as a circular loop, and the net magnetic field is the vector sum of the fields resulting from all the turns (as done in Art. 26.9). If the turns are closely spaced and the solenoid is of infinite length, the magnetic field lines are as shown in Fig. 26.53. One end of the solenoid behaves like the north pole ( ) and the opposite end behaves like the south pole ( ). As the length of the solenoid increases, the interior field becomes more uniform and the exterior field becomes weaker. An ideal solenoid is approached when the turns are closely spaced and the length is much greater than the radius of the turns. In this case, the external field is zero, and the interior field is uniform over a great volume. We can use Ampere\u2019s law to obtain an expression for the interior magnetic field in an ideal solenoid. Fig. 26.54 shows a longitudinal cross-section of part of such a solenoid carrying a current i. Because the solenoid is ideal, B in the interior space is uniform and parallel to the axis, and B in the exterior space is zero. Consider the rectangular path of length land width w as shown in figure. We can apply Ampere\u2019s law to this path by evaluating the line integral B l \u22c5d over each side of the rectangle. 366 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism N S Fig. 26.53 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 4 w 1 2 3 l Fig. 26.54  ( ) B l \u22c5 = \u222b d side 3 0 as B = 0 ( ) B l \u22c5 = \u222b d side 2 and 4 0 as B l \u22a5d or B = 0 along these paths ( ) B l \u22c5 = \u222b d Bl side1 as B is uniform and parallel to dl The integral over the closed rectangular path is therefore, B l \u22c5 = \u222b d Bl The right side of Ampere\u2019s law involves the total current passing through the area bounded by the path of integration. In this case, inet = (number of turns inside the area) (current through each turn) = ( ) ( ) nl i (n = number of turns per unit length) Using Ampere\u2019s law, B l \u22c5 = \u222b d i \u00b5 0 net or Bl nli = ( ) ( ) \u00b5 0 or B ni = \u00b5 0 \u2026(v) This result is same as obtained in Art. 26.9. Eq. (v) is valid only for points near the centre (that is far from the ends) of a very long solenoid. The field near each end is half the value given by Eq. (v). V Example 26.17 A closed curve encircles several conductors. The line integral B l \u22c5 \u222b d around this curve is 3.83 - \u00d7 \u2212 10 7 T m. (a) What is the net current in the conductors?

The device consists of a conducting wire wrapped around a ring (a torus) made of a non-conducting material. For a toroid having N closely spaced turns of wire, calculate the magnetic field in the region occupied by the torus, a distance r from the centre. Solution To calculate this field, we must evaluate B l \u22c5 \u222b d over the circle of radius r. By symmetry we see that the magnitude of the field is constant on this circle and tangent to it. So, B l \u22c5 = = \u222b d Bl B r ( ) 2\u03c0 Furthermore, the circular closed path surrounds N loops of wire, each of which carries a current i. Therefore, right side of Eq. (i) is \u00b5 0Ni in this case. \u2234 B l \u22c5 = \u222b d i \u00b5 0 net or B r Ni ( ) 2 0 \u03c0 \u00b5 = or B Ni r = \u00b5 \u03c0 0 2 This result shows that B r \u221d1 and hence is non-uniform in the region occupied by torus. However, if r is very large compared with the cross-sectional radius of the torus, then the field is approximately uniform inside the torus. In that case, N r n 2\u03c0 = = number of turns per unit length of torus \u2234 B ni = \u00b5 0 Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 369 i i r B Fig. 26.56 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 \u00d7 Fig. 26.57  For an ideal toroid, in which turns are closely spaced, the external magnetic field is zero. This is because the net current passing through any circular path lying outside the toroid is zero. Therefore, from Ampere\u2019s law we find that B = 0, in the regions exterior to the torus. 1. Figure given in the question is a cross-sectional view of a coaxial cable. The centre conductor is surrounded by a rubber layer, which is surrounded by an outer conductor, which is surrounded by another rubber layer. The current in the inner conductor is 1.0 A out of the page, and the current in the outer conductor is 3.0 A into the page.

If two such charges of opposite sign are placed near each other, they form an electric dipole characterized by an electric dipole moment p. In magnetism isolated magnetic \u2018poles\u2019 which would correspond to isolated electric charges do not exist. The simplest magnetic structure is the magnetic dipole, characterized by a magnetic dipole moment M. A current loop, a bar magnet and a solenoid of finite length are examples of magnetic dipoles. When a magnetic dipole is placed in an external magnetic field B, a magnetic torque \u03c4 acts on it, which is given by \u03c4 = \u00d7 M B Alternatively, we can measure B due to the dipole at a point along its axis a (large) distance r from its centre by the expression, B M r = \u22c5 \u00b5 \u03c0 0 3 4 2 372 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism 3 cm 5 cm D C G 30 A 10 A 20 A Fig. 26.61  A bar magnet might be viewed as two poles (North and South) separated by some distance. However, all attempts to isolate these poles fail. If a magnet is broken, the fragments prove to be dipoles and not isolated poles. If we break up a magnet into the electrons and nuclei that make up its atoms, it will be found that even these elementary particles are magnetic dipoles. Each current carrying loop is just like a magnetic dipole, whose magnetic dipole moment is given by   M A = ni Here, n is the number of turns in the loop, i is the current and A represents the area vector of the current loop. The behaviour of a current loop can be described by the following hypothetical model: (i) There are two magnetic charges; positive magnetic charge and negative magnetic charge. We call the positive magnetic charge a north pole and the negative magnetic charge as the south pole.  Every pole has a pole strength m. The unit of pole strength is A-m. (ii) A magnetic charge placed in a magnetic field experiences a force, F B = m The force on positive magnetic charge is along the field and a force on a negative magnetic charge  is opposite to the field. (iii) A magnetic dipole is formed when a negative magnetic charge \u2212m and a positive magnetic charge +m are placed at a small separation d. The magnetic dipole moment is M md = The direction of M is from \u2212m to +m. Geometrical Length and Magnetic Length In case of a bar magnet, the poles appear at points which are slightly inside the two ends. The distance between the locations of the assumed poles is called the magnetic length of the magnet. The distance between the ends is called the geometrical length. The magnetic length of a bar magnet is written as 2l. If m be the pole strength and 2l the magnetic length of a bar magnet, then its magnetic moment is M ml = 2 Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 373 N S N S N S N S Fig. 26.62 If a bar magnet is broken, each fragment becomes a small dipole.

Direction of M is from south pole (S) to north pole (N). \u0098 The behaviour of a magnetic dipole (may be a bar magnet also) is similar to the behaviour of an electric dipole. The only difference is that the electric dipole moment p is replaced by magnetic dipole moment M and the constant  1 4 0 \u03c0\u03b5  is replaced by \u00b5 \u03c0 0 4 . \u0098 Table given below makes a comparison between an electric dipole and a magnetic dipole.

The value of magnetic field on the surface of earth is a few tenths of a gauss ( ) 1 10 4 G T = \u2212 . The earth\u2019s south magnetic pole is located near the north  geographic pole and the earth\u2019s north magnetic pole is located near the south geographic pole. In fact, the configuration of the earth\u2019s magnetic field is very much like the one that would be achieved by burying a gigantic bar magnet deep in the interior of the earth. The axis of earth\u2019s magnet makes an angle of 11.5\u00b0 with the earth\u2019s rotational axis.

Later on this theory was denied because the temperature in the interior of the earth is so high that it is impossible to retain its magnetism. Second Theory : The second theory was put forward by Grover in 1849. He put the view that the earth magnetism is due to electric currents flowing near the outer surface of the earth. Hot air, rising from the region near equator, goes towards north and south hemispheres and become electrified. These currents magnetise the ferromagnetic material near the outer surface of the earth. Third Theory : There are many conducting materials including iron and nickel in the molten state within the central core of the earth. Conventional currents are generated in this semifluid core due to earth\u2019s rotation about its axis. Due to these currents, magnetism is generated within the earth. Till date not a single theory can explain all events regarding earth\u2019s magnetism. Elements of Earth\u2019s Magnetism There are three elements of earth\u2019s magnetism. (i) Angle of Declination ( ) \u03b1  At any point (say P) on earth\u2019s surface the longitude determines the north-south direction. The vertical plane in the direction of longitude or the vertical plane passing through the line joining the geographical north and south poles is called the \u2018geographical meridian\u2019. At point P, there also exists the magnetic field B. A vertical plane in the direction of B is called \u2018magnetic meridian\u2019. At any place the acute angle between the magnetic meridian and the geographical meridian is called \u2018angle of declination \u2018\u03b1\u2019. (ii) Angle of Dip ( ) \u03b8  \u2018The angle of dip ( ) \u03b8  at a place is the angle between the direction of earth\u2019s magnetic field and the horizontal at that place.\u2019 Angle of dip at some place can be measured from a magnetic needle free to rotate in a vertical plane about a horizontal axis passing through centre of gravity of the needle. At earth\u2019s magnetic poles the magnetic field of earth is vertical, i.e. angle of dip is 90\u00b0, the freely suspended magnetic  needle is vertical there. At magnetic equator field is horizontal, or angle of dip is 0\u00b0. The needle is horizontal. In northern hemisphere, the north pole of the magnetic needle inclines downwards, whereas in the southern hemisphere the south pole of the needle inclines downwards. (iii) Horizontal Component of Earth\u2019s Magnetic Field Let Be be the net magnetic field at some point. H and V be the horizontal and vertical components of Be. Let \u03b8 is the angle of dip at the same place, then we can see that 376 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism \u03b1 O R N S L H \u03b8 Magnetic North Geographical North  Geographical meridian Magnetic meridian M ",

Neutral Points When a magnet is placed at some point on earth\u2019s surface, there are points where horizontal component of earth\u2019s magnetic field is just equal and opposite to the field due to the magnet. Such points are called neutral points. If a magnetic compass is placed at a neutral point, no force acts on it and it may set in any direction.

Experiments show that magnetic lines also get modified due to the presence of certain materials in the magnetic field. Few substances such as O2, air, platinum, aluminium etc., show a very small increase in the magnetic flux passing through them, when placed in a magnetic field. Such substances are called paramagnetic substances. Few other substances such as H , H O, Cu, Zn 2 2 , Sb etc. show a very small  decrease in flux and are said to be diamagnetic. There are other substances like Fe, Co etc. through which the flux increases to a larger value and are known as ferromagnetic substances. Magnetisation of Matter A material body is consisting of large number of atoms and thus large number of electrons. Each electron produces orbital and spin magnetic moments and can be assumed as magnetic dipoles. In the absence of any external magnetic field, the dipoles of individual atoms are randomly oriented and the magnetic moments thus, cancel. When we apply an external magnetic field to a substance, two processes may occur. (i) All atoms which have non-zero magnetic moment are aligned along the magnetic field. (ii) If the atom has a zero magnetic moment, the applied magnetic field distorts the electron orbit and  thus, induces magnetic moment in opposite directions. In diatomic substances, the individual atoms do not have a magnetic moment by its own. When an external field is applied, the second process occurs. The induced magnetic moment is thus set up in the direction opposite to B. In this case, the magnetic flux density in the interior of the body will be less than that of the external field B. In paramagnetic substances, the constituent atoms have intrinsic magnetic moments. When an external magnetic field is applied, both of the above processes occur and the resultant magnetic moment is always in the direction of magnetic field B as the first effect predominates over the second. 26.15 Some Important Terms Used in Magnetism Magnetic Induction ( ) B When a piece of any substance is placed in an external magnetic field, the substance becomes magnetised. If an iron bar is placed in a uniform magnetic field, the magnetised bar produces its own magnetic field in the same direction as those of the original field inside the bar, but in opposite direction outside the bar. This results in a concentration of the lines of force within the bar. The magnetic flux density within the bar is increased whereas it becomes weak at certain places outside the bar. \u201cThe number of magnetic lines of induction inside a magnetic substance crossing unit area normal to their direction is called the magnitude of magnetic induction, or magnetic flux density inside the Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 381 S N (a) S N (b) Fig. 26.69  substance. It is denoted by B. The SI unit of B is tesla (T) or weber/metre 2 (Wb/m 2). The CGS unit is gauss (G). 1Wb/m = 1T = 10 G 2 4 Intensity of Magnetisation ( ) I \u201cIntensity of magnetisation ( ) I  is defined as the magnetic moment per unit volume of the magnetised substance.\u201d This basically represents the extent to which the substance is magnetised. Thus, I M V = The SI unit of I is ampere/metre (A/m). Magnetic Intensity or Magnetic Field Strength ( ) H When a substance is placed in an external magnetic field, the actual magnetic field inside the substance is the sum of the external field and the field due to its magnetisation. The capability of the magnetising field to magnetise the substance is expressed by means of a vector  H, called the \u2018magnetic intensity\u2019 of the field. It is defined through the vector relation, H B I = \u2212 \u00b5 0 The SI unit of H is same as that of I, i.e. ampere/metre (A/m). The CGS unit is oersted. Magnetic Permeability ( ) \u00b5 \u201cIt is defined as the ratio of the magnetic induction B inside the magnetised substance to the magnetic intensity H of the magnetising field, i.e. \u00b5 = B H It is basically a measure of conduction of magnetic lines of force through it. The SI unit of magnetic permeability is weber/ampere-metre (Wb/A-m). Relative Magnetic Permeability ( ) \u00b5r It is the ratio of the magnetic permeability \u00b5 of the substance to the permeability of free space. Thus,  \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5 r = 0 \u00b5 r  is a pure ratio, hence, dimensionless. For vacuum its value is 1. \u00b5 r  can also be defined as the ratio of the magnetic field B in the substance when placed in magnetic field B0. Thus, \u00b5 r B B = 0 For paramagnetic substance, \u00b5 r >1, For diamagnetic substance, \u00b5 r <1 and For ferromagnetic substance, \u00b5 r > >1. 382 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism  Magnetic Susceptibility ( ) \u03c7m We know that both diamagnetic and paramagnetic substances develop a magnetic moment depending  on the applied field. Magnetic susceptibility is a measure of how easily a substance is magnetised in a magnetising field. For paramagnetic and diamagnetic substances, I, H and \u03c7 m are related by the equation, I H = \u03c7 m   or   \u03c7 m I H =              Thus, the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 m may be defined as the ratio of the intensity of magnetisation to the magnetic intensity of the magnetising field. Since, I and H have the same units, \u03c7 m is unitless. It is a pure number. By doing simple calculation, we can prove that \u00b5 r  and \u03c7 m are related by \u00b5 \u03c7 r m = + 1 For paramagnetic substances \u03c7 m is slightly positive. For diamagnetic substances, it is slightly negative and for ferromagnetic substances, \u03c7 m is positive and very large. 26.16 Properties of Magnetic Materials As discussed earlier, all substances (whether solid, liquid or gaseous) may be classified into three categories in terms of their magnetic properties. (i) paramagnetic, (ii) diamagnetic and (iii) ferromagnetic. Paramagnetic Substances Examples of such substances are platinum, aluminium, chromium, manganese, CuSO4 solution etc. They have the following properties: (i) The substances when placed in a magnetic field, acquire a feeble magnetisation in the same sense  as the applied field. Thus, the magnetic inductance inside the substance is slightly greater than outside to it. (ii) In a uniform magnetic field, these substances rotate until their longest axes are parallel to the field. (iii) These substances are attracted towards regions of stronger magnetic field when placed in a non-uniform magnetic field. Figure shows a strong electromagnet in which one of the pole pieces is sharply pointed while the other is flat. Magnetic field is much stronger near the pointed pole than near the flat pole. If a small piece of paramagnetic material is suspended in this region, a force can be observed in the direction of arrow. Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 383 S N Fig. 26.70  (iv) If a paramagnetic liquid is filled in a narrow U-tube and one limb is placed in between the pole pieces of an electromagnet such that the level of the liquid is in line with the field, then the liquid will rise in the limb as the field is switched on. (v) For paramagnetic substances, the relative permeability \u00b5 r  is slightly greater than one. (vi) At a given temperature the magnetic susceptibility \u03c7 m does not change with the magnetising field. However, it varies inversely as the absolute temperature. As temperature increases, \u03c7 m decreases. At some higher temperature, \u03c7 m becomes negative and the substance becomes diamagnetic. Diamagnetic Substances Examples of such substances are bismuth, antimony, gold, quartz, water, alcohol etc. They have the following properties: (i) These substances when placed in a magnetic field, acquire feeble magnetisation in a direction opposite to that of the applied field. Thus, the lines of induction inside the substance is smaller than that outside to it. (ii) In a uniform field, these substances rotate until their longest  axes are normal to the field. (iii) In a non-uniform field, these substances move from stronger to weaker parts of the field. (iv) If a diamagnetic liquid is filled in a narrow U-tube and one limb is placed in between the pole of an electromagnet, the level of liquid depresses when the field is switched on. (v) The relative permeability \u00b5 r  is slightly less than 1. (vi) The susceptibility \u03c7 m of such substances is always negative. It is constant and does not vary with field or the temperature. Ferromagnetic Substances Examples of such substances are iron, nickel, steel, cobalt and their alloys. These substances resemble to a higher degree with paramagnetic substances as regard their behaviour. They have the following additional properties: (i) These substances are strongly magnetised by even a weak magnetic field. (ii) The relative permeability is very large and is of the order of hundreds and thousands. (iii) The susceptibility is positive and very large. 384 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism Fig. 26.71 N S Fig. 26.72  (iv) Susceptibility remains constant for very small values of H, increases for larger values of H and then decreases for very large values of H. (v) Susceptibility decreases steadily with the rise of temperature. Above a certain temperature known as Curie Temperature, the ferromagnetic substances become paramagnetic. It is 1000\u00b0C for iron, 770\u00b0C for steel, 360\u00b0C for nickel and 1150\u00b0C for cobalt. 26.17 Explanation of Paramagnetism, Diamagnetism   and Ferromagnetism There are three properties of atoms that give rise to magnetic dipole moment. 1. The electrons moving around the nucleus in the orbits act as small current loops and contribute magnetic moments. 2. The spinning electron has an intrinsic magnetic dipole moment. 3. The nucleus contribute to magnetic moment due to the motion of charge within the nucleus. The magnitude of nuclear moments is about 10 3 \u2212 times that of electronic moments or the spin magnetic moments, as the later two are of the same order. Still most of the magnetic moment of an atom is produced by electron spin, the net contribution of the orbital revolution is very small. This is because most of the electrons pair off in such a way that they produce equal and opposite orbital magnetic moment and they cancel out. Although, the electrons also try to pair up with their opposite spins but in case of spin motion of an electron it is not always possible to form equal and opposite pairs. Paramagnetism The property of paramagnetism is found in those substances whose atoms or molecules have an excess of electrons spinning in the same direction. Hence, atoms of paramagnetic substances have a permanent magnetic moment and behave like tiny bar magnets. In the absence of external magnetic field, the atomic magnets are randomly oriented and net magnetic moment is thus, zero. When paramagnetic substance is placed in an external magnetic field, then each atomic magnet experiences a torque which tends to turn the magnet in the direction of the field. The atomic magnets are thus, aligned in the direction of the field. Thus, the whole substance is magnetised in the direction of the external magnetic field. As the temperature of substance is increased, the thermal agitation disturbs the magnetic alignment of  the atoms. Thus, we can say that paramagnetism is temperature dependent. Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 385 Tiny bar magnets In the absence of external magnetic field Fig. 26.73 Fig. 26.74  Curie\u2019s law   According to Curie\u2019s law, magnetic susceptibility of a paramagnetic substance is inversely proportional to absolute temperature T. \u03c7 m T \u221d1 The exact law is beyond the scope of our course. Diamagnetism The property of diamagnetism is generally found in those substances whose atoms (or molecules) have even number of electrons which form pairs. \u201cThe net magnetic moment of an atom of a diamagnetic substance is thus zero.\u201d When a diamagnetic substance is placed in an external magnetic field, the spin motion of electrons is so modified that the electrons which produce the magnetic moments in the direction of external field slow down while the electrons which produce magnetic moments in opposite direction get accelerated. Thus, a net magnetic moment is induced in the opposite directions of applied magnetic field. Hence, the substance is magnetised opposite to the external field.  Note That diamagnetism is temperature independent. Ferromagnetism Iron like elements and their alloys are known as ferromagnetic substances. The susceptibility of these substances is in several thousands. Like paramagnetic substances, atoms of ferromagnetic substances have a permanent magnetic moment and behave like tiny magnets. But in ferromagnetic substances the atoms form innumerable small effective regions called \u2018domains\u2019. The size of the domain vary from about 10 6 3 \u2212cm  to 10 2 3 \u2212cm . Each domain has 1017 to 1021 atoms whose magnetic moments are aligned in the same direction. In an unmagnetised ferromagnetic specimen, the domains are oriented randomly, so that their resultant magnetic moment is zero. 386 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism (a) (b) External field Fig. 26.76 Unmagnetised Fig. 26.75  When the specimen is placed in a magnetic field, the resultant magnetisation may increase in two different ways. (a) The domains which are oriented favourably with respect to the field increase in size. Whereas those oriented opposite to the external field are reduced. (b) The domains rotate towards the field direction.  Note That if the external field is weak, specimen gets magnetised by the first method and if the field is strong they get magnetised by the second method. Hysteresis : Retentivity and Coercivity The distinguishing characteristics of a ferromagnetic material is not that it can be strongly magnetised  but that the intensity of magnetisation I is not directly proportional to the magnetising field H. If a gradually increasing magnetic field H is applied to an unmagnetised piece of iron, its magnetisation increases non-linearly until it reaches a maximum. If I is plotted against H, a curve like OA is obtained. This curve is known as magnetisation curve. At this stage all the dipoles are aligned and I has reached to a maximum or saturated value. If the magnetic field H is now decreased, the I does not return along magnetisation curve but follows path AB. At H I = 0,  does not come to its zero value but its value is still near the saturated value. The value of I at this point (i.e. OB) is known as remanence, remanent magnetisation or retentivity. The value of I at this point is known as residual induction. On applying a reverse field the value of I finally becomes zero. The abscissa OC represents the reversed magnetic field needed to demagnetise the specimen. This is known as coercivity of the material. If the reverse field is further increased, a reverse magnetisation is set up which quickly reaches the saturation value. This is shown as CD. If H is now taken back from its negative saturation value to its original positive saturation value, a similar curve DEFA will be traced. The whole graph ABCDEFA thus, forms a closed loop, usually known as hysteresis loop. The whole process described above and the property of the iron characterized by it are called hysteresis. The energy lost per unit volume of a substance in a complete cycle is equal to the area. Thus, we can conclude the following three points from the above discussion: (i) The retentivity of a substance is a measure of the magnetisation remaining in the substance when the magnetising field is removed. (ii) The coercivity of a substance is a measure of the reverse magnetising field required to destroy the  residual magnetism of the substance. Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 387 I A Retentivity C O F H E D B Coercivity Fig. 26.77  (iii) The energy loss per unit volume of a substance in a complete cycle of magnetisation is equal to the area of the hysteresis loop. Demagnetisation  It is clear from the hysteresis loop that the intensity of magnetisation I does  not reduce to zero on removing the magnetising field H. Further, I is zero when the magnetising field H is equal to the coercive field. At these points the magnetic induction is not zero, and the specimen is not demagnetised. To demagnetise a substance, it is subjected to several cycles is magnetisation, each time with decreasing magnetising field and finally the field is reduced to zero. In this way, the size of the hysteresis curve goes on decreasing and the area finally reduces to zero. Demagnetisation is obtained by placing the specimen in an alternating field of continuously diminishing amplitude. It is also obtained by heating.  Ferromagnetic materials become practically non-magnetic at sufficiently high temperatures. Magnetic Properties of Soft Iron and Steel A comparison of the magnetic properties of ferromagnetic substances can be made by the comparison  of the shapes and sizes of their hysteresis loops. Following three conclusions can be drawn from their hysteresis loops: (i) Retentivity of soft iron is more than the retentivity of steel. (ii) Coercivity of soft iron is less than the coercivity of steel. (iii) Area of hysteresis loop (i.e. hysteresis loss) in soft iron is smaller than that in steel. Choice of Magnetic Materials The choice of a magnetic material for different uses is decided from the hysteresis curve of a specimen of the material. (i) Permanent Magnets The materials for a permanent magnet should have (a) high retentivity (so that the magnet is strong) and (b) high coercivity (so that the magnetising is not wiped out by stray magnetic fields). As the material in this case is never put to cyclic changes of magnetisation, hence, hysteresis is immaterial. From the point of view of these facts steel is more suitable for the construction of permanent magnets than soft iron. Modern permanent magnets are made of \u2018cobalt-steel\u2019, alloys \u2018ticonal\u2019. (ii) Electromagnets The materials for the construction of electromagnets should have (a) high initial permeability (b) low hysteresis loss From the view point of these facts, soft iron is an ideal material for this purpose. (iii) Transformer Cores and Telephone Diaphragms As the magnetic material used in these cases is subjected to cyclic changes. Thus, the essential requirements for the selection of the material are (a) high initial permeability (b) low hysteresis loss to prevent the breakdown 388 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism H I Fig. 26.78  Electromagnet As we know that a current carrying solenoid behaves like a bar magnet. If we place a soft iron rod in the solenoid, the magnetism of the solenoid increases hundreds of times and the solenoid is called an \u2018electromagnet\u2019. It is a temporary magnet. An electromagnet is made by winding closely a number of turns of insulated copper wire over a soft iron straight rod or a horse shoe rod. On passing current through this solenoid, a magnetic field is produced in the space within the solenoid. Applications of Electromagnets (i) Electromagnets are used in electric bell, transformer, telephone diaphragms etc. (ii) In medical field, they are used in extracting bullets from the human body. (iii) Large electromagnets are used in cranes for lifting and transferring big machines and parts. 26.18 Moving Coil Galvanometer The moving coil galvanometer is a device used to measure an electric current. Principle Action of a moving coil galvanometer is based upon the principle that when a current carrying coil is placed in a magnetic field, it experiences a torque whose magnitude depends on the magnitude of current. Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 389 N S (a) N S (b) Fig. 26.79 S M W T South Coil Soft iron    core North South S Core F F N \u00d7 Fig. 26.80  Construction The main parts of a moving coil galvanometer are shown in figure. The galvanometer consists of a coil, with many turns free to rotate about a fixed vertical axis in a uniform radial magnetic field. There  is a cylindrical soft iron core, which not only makes the field radial but also increases the strength of magnetic field. Theory The current to be measured is passed through the galvanometer. As the coil is in the magnetic field (of  constant magnitude) it experiences a torque given by  \u03c4 \u03b8 = MB sin             = ( ) sin NiA B \u03b8 ...(i) As shown in the figure, the pole pieces are made cylindrical, the magnetic field always remains parallel to the plane of the coil. Or angle between B and M always remains 90o. Therefore, Eq. (i) can be written as             \u03c4 = NiAB                                                       (as sin sin \u03b8 = = 90 1 o ) Here, N = total number of turns of the coil             i = current passing through the coil           A = area of cross-section of the coil and            B = magnitude of radial magnetic field. This torque rotates the coil. The spring S shown in figure provides a counter torque k\u03c6 that balances the above torque NiAB. In equilibrium,  k NiAB \u03c6 = ...(ii) Here, k is the torsional constant of the spring. With rotation of coil a small light mirror M (attached with phosphor bronze wire W ) also rotates and equilibrium deflection \u03c6  can be measured by a lamp and scale arrangement. The above Eq. (ii) can be written as  i k ",

The electrons so produced are allowed to pass through slits A1 and A2 also kept at the potential of A.

Cyclotron In 1932, Lawrence developed a machine named cyclotron, for the acceleration of charged particles, such as protons or deuterons. These particles (ions) are caused to move in circular orbits by magnetic field and are accelerated by the electric field. In its simplest form, it consists of two flat semicircular metal boxes, called dees because of their shape. These hollow chambers have their diametric edges parallel and slightly separated from each other. An alternating potential (with frequency of the order of megacycles per second) is applied between the dees. The dees are placed between the poles of a strong electromagnet which provides a magnetic field perpendicular to the plane of the dees. Suppose that at any particular instant the alternating potential is in the direction which makes D1 positive and D2 negative. A positive ion of mass m, charge q starting from the source S (of positive ion) will be attracted by the dee D2. Let its velocity while entering in dee D2 is v. Due to magnetic field B, it will move in a circular path of radius r inside the dee D2, where r mv Bq = or v Bqr m = Chapter 26 Magnetics \u0097 393 Magnet S Magnet ",

        "content": " In the interior of the dee, the speed of the ion remains constant. After it has traversed half a cycle, the ion comes to the edge of D2. If in the meantime, the potential difference between D1 and D2 has changed direction so that D2 is now positive and D1 negative, the positive ion will receive an additional  acceleration, while going across the gap between the dees and  speed of ion will increase. Then, it travels in a circular path of larger radius inside D1 under the influence of magnetic field (because r v \u221d). After traversing a half cycle in D1, it will reach the edge of D1 and receive an additional acceleration between the gaps because in the meantime the direction of potential difference between the dees has changed. The ion will continue travelling in a semicircle of increasing radii, the direction of potential difference changes every time the ion goes from D1 to D2 and from D2 to D1. The time taken by the charged particle to traverse the semicircular path in the dee is given by t r v m Bq = = \u03c0 \u03c0 / \u2026(i) This relation indicates that time t is independent of the velocity of the particle and of the radius. For any given value of m q / , it is determined by the magnetic field intensity. By adjusting the magnetic field intensity the time can be made the same as that required to change the potentials. On the other hand, the oscillator frequency (of alternating potential) can also be adjusted to the nature of a given ion and to the strength of the magnetic field. The frequency of the oscillations required to keep the ion in phase is given by the relation f T t Bq m = = = 1 1 2 2\u03c0 \u2026(ii) If the oscillation frequency is adjusted to keep the charged ion always in phase, each time the ion crosses the gap it receives an additional energy and at the same time it describes a flat spiral of increasing radius. Eventually, the ion reaches the periphery of the dee, where it can be brought out of the chamber by means of a deflecting plate charged to a high negative potential. This attractive force draws the ion out of its spiral path and thus can be used easily. If R is the radius of the dee, kinetic energy of the ion emerging from the cyclotron is thus given by K mv m BqR m = = 1 2 1 2 2 2 ( / )                    K B R q m = 2 2 2 2 /                                            \u2026(iii) This relation indicates that the maximum energy attained by the ion is limited by the radius R, magnetic field B or the frequency of the alternating potential f. It is independent of the alternating voltage. It can be explained by the fact that when the voltage is low, the ion makes a large number of turns before reaching the periphery, but when the voltage is high the number of turns is small. The total energy remains same in both the cases provided B and R are unchanged.  Note The cyclotron is used to bombard nuclei with energetic particles and study the resulting nuclear reactions. It is also used in hospitals to produce radioactive substances which can be used in diagnosis and treatment. Cyclotron is suitable only for accelerating heavy particles like proton, deuteron, \u03b1-particle etc. Electrons cannot be accelerated by the cyclotron because the mass of the electron is small and a small increase in energy of the electron makes the electrons move with a very high speed. The uncharged particles (e.g., neutrons) cannot be accelerated by cyclotron. 394 \u0097 Elec tric ity and Mag ne tism  ",

As the velocity vector v makes an angle \u03b8 with B,its path is a helix. The plane of the circle of the helix is yz (perpendicular to magnetic field) and axis of the helix is parallel to x-axis.

Based on the magnetic force on a charged particle in electric and (or) magnetic field V Example 15 Consider the motion of a positive point charge in a region where there are simultaneous uniform electric and magnetic fields E j = E0$ and B j = B0$. At time t = 0, this charge has velocity v in the xy-plane making an angle \u03b8 with the x-axis. Which of the following option(s) is(are) correct for time t > 0? (JEE 2012) (a) If \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 , the charge moves in a circular path in the xz-plane. (b) If \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 , the charge undergoes helical motion with constant pitch along the y-axis (c) If \u03b8 = \u00b0 10 , the charge undergoes helical motion with its pitch increasing with time along the y-axis. (d) If \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 , the charge undergoes linear but accelerated motion along the y-axis. Solution Magnetic field will rotate the particle in a circular path (in xz-plane or perpendicular to B). Electric field will exert a constant force on the particle in positive y-direction. Therefore, resultant path is neither purely circular nor helical or the options (a) and (b) both are wrong. (c) v\u22a5and Bwill rotate the particle in a circular path in xz- plane (or perpendicular to B ). Further, v||and Ewill move the particle (with increasing speed) along positive y-axis (or along the axis of above circular path). Therefore, the resultant path is helical with increasing pitch along the y-axis (or along B and E ). Therefore, option (c) is correct. (d) Magnetic force is zero, as \u03b8 between B and v is zero. But, electric force will act in y-direction. Therefore, motion is 1-D and uniformly accelerated (towards positive y-direction). Therefore, option (d) is also correct.

But for most of the electric devices used in industry the source of emf is not a battery but an electrical generating station. In these stations other forms of energy are converted into electric energy. For example, in a hydroelectric plant gravitational potential energy is converted into electric energy. Similarly, in a nuclear plant nuclear energy is converted into electric energy. But how this conversion is done? Or what is the physics behind this? The branch of physics, known as electromagnetic induction gives the answer to all these queries. If the magnetic flux( ) \u03c6B through a circuit changes, an emf and a current are induced in the circuit. Electromagnetic induction was discovered in 1830. The central principle of electromagnetic induction is Faraday\u2019s law. This law relates induced emf to change in magnetic flux in any loop, including a closed circuit. We will also discuss Lenz\u2019s law, which helps us to predict the directions of induced emf and current. 27.2 Magnetic Field Lines and Magnetic Flux Let us first discuss the concept of magnetic field lines and magnetic flux. We can represent any magnetic field by magnetic field lines. Unlike the electric lines of force, it is wrong to call them magnetic lines of force, because they do not point in the direction of the force on a charge. The force on a moving charged particle is always perpendicular to the magnetic field (or magnetic field lines) at the particle\u2019s position. The idea of magnetic field lines is same as for the electric field lines as discussed in the chapter of electrostatics. The magnetic field at any point is tangential to the field line at that point. Where the field lines are close, the magnitude of field is large, where the field lines are far apart, the field magnitude is small. Also, because the direction of Bat each point is unique, field lines never intersect. Unlike the electric field lines, magnetic lines form a closed loop. Magnetic Flux The flux associated with a magnetic field is defined in a similar manner to that used to define electric flux. Consider an element of area dS on an arbitrary shaped surface as shown in figure. If the magnetic field at this element is B, the magnetic flux through the element is d d BdS B \u03c6 = \u22c5 = B S cos\u03b8 Here, dSis a vector that is perpendicular to the surface and has a magnitude equal to the area dS and\u03b8 is the angle between B and dS at that element. In general, d B \u03c6 varies from element to element. The total magnetic flux through the surface is the sum of the contributions from the individual area elements. \u2234 \u03c6 = = \u22c5 \u222b \u222b B BdS d cos\u03b8 B S 456 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism B \u03b8 dS Fig. 27.1  Note down the following points regarding the magnetic flux : (i) Magnetic flux is a scalar quantity (dot product of two vector quantities is a scalar quantity) (ii) The SI unit of magnetic flux is tesla-metre 2 ( ) 1 2 T-m . This unit is called weber (1Wb). 1 1 1 2 Wb T-m N-m/A = = Thus, unit of magnetic field is also weber/m 2 (1Wb/m 2). or 1 1 2 T Wb/m = (iii) In the special case in which B is uniform over a plane surface with total area S, \u03c6 = B BS cos\u03b8 If B is perpendicular to the surface, then cos\u03b8 =1and \u03c6 = B ",

        "content": "Gauss\u2019s Law for Magnetism In Gauss\u2019s law, the total electric flux through a closed surface is proportional to the total electric charge enclosed by the surface. For example, if a closed surface encloses an electric dipole, the total electric flux is zero because the total charge is zero. By analogy, if there were such as thing as a single magnetic charge (magnetic monopole), the total magnetic flux through a closed surface would be proportional to the total magnetic charge enclosed. But as no magnetic monopole has ever been observed, we conclude that the total magnetic flux through a closed surface is zero. B S \u22c5 = \u222b d 0 Unlike electric field lines that begin and end on electric charges, magnetic field lines never have end points. Such a point would otherwise indicate the existence of a monopole. For a closed surface, the vector area element dSalways points out of the surface. However, for an open surface we choose one of the possible sides of the surface to be the positive and use that choice consistently. 27.3 Faraday\u2019s Law This law states that, \u201cthe induced emf in a closed loop equals the negative of the time rate of change of magnetic flux through the loop.\u201d e d dt B = \u03c6 \u2013 Chapter 27 Electromagnetic Induction \u0097 457 \u03b8 B S \u03c6 \u03b8 B = BS cos B S \u03c6B = BS Fig. 27.2  If a circuit is a coil consisting of N loops all of the same area and if\u03c6B is the flux through one loop, an emf is induced in every loop, thus the total induced emf in the coil is given by the expression, e N d dt B = \u03c6 \u2013 The negative sign in the above equations is of important physical significance, which we will discuss in article. 27.4. Note down the following points regarding the Faraday\u2019s law: (i) As we have seen, induced emf is produced only when there is a change in magnetic flux passing through a loop. The flux passing through the loop is given by \u03c6 = BS cos\u03b8 This, flux can be changed in several ways: (a) The magnitude of B can change with time. In the problems if magnetic field is given a function of time, it implies that the magnetic field is changing. Thus, B B t = ( ) (b) The current producing the magnetic field can change with time. For this, the current can be given as a function of time. Hence, i i t = ( ) (c) The area of the loop inside the magnetic field can change with time.This can be done by pulling a loop inside (or outside) a magnetic field. (d) The angle \u03b8 between B and the normal to the loop (or s) can change with time. This can be done by rotating a loop in a magnetic field. (e) Any combination of the above can occur. (ii) When the magnetic flux passing through a loop is changed, an induced emf and hence, an induced current is produced in the circuit. If R is the resistance of the circuit, then induced current is given by i e R R d dt B = = \u03c6 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 \u2013 458 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism Fig. 27.3 \u03c9 Fig. 27.4  Current starts flowing in the circuit, means flow of charge takes place. Charge flown in the circuit in time dt will be given by dq idt R d B = = \u03c6 1 (\u2013 ) Thus, for a time interval \u2206t we can write the average values as, e t B = \u03c6 \u2013 \u2206 \u2206, i R t B = \u03c6 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 \u2013\u2206 \u2206 and \u2206 \u2206 q R B = \u03c6 1 (\u2013 ) From these equations, we can see that e and i are inversely proportional to \u2206t while \u2206q is independent of \u2206t. It depends on the magnitude of change in flux, not the time taken in it. This can be explained by the following example. V Example 27.1 A square loop ACDE of area 20 2 cm and resistance 5 \u2126is rotated in a magnetic field B = 2T through 180\u00b0, (a) in 0.01 s and (b) in 0.02 s Find the magnitudes of average values of e, i and \u2206q in both the cases. Solution Let us take the area vector S perpendicular to plane of loop inwards. So initially, S B \u2191\u2191 and when it is rotated by 180\u00b0, S B \u2191\u2193 . Hence, initial flux passing through the loop, \u03c6 = \u00b0 = \u00d7 = \u00d7 i BS cos ( ) ( ) ( ) \u2013 \u2013 0 2 20 10 1 10 4 3 4.0 Wb Flux passing through the loop when it is rotated by 180\u00b0, \u03c6 = \u00b0 = \u00d7 = \u00d7 f BS cos ( ) ( ) (\u2013 ) \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 180 2 20 10 1 10 4 3 4.0 Wb Therefore, change in flux, \u2206\u03c6 = \u03c6 \u03c6 = \u00d7 B f i \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 8.0 Wb 10 3 (a) Given, \u2206t = 0.01s, R = 5 \u2126 \u2234 | | \u2013 \u2013 e t B = \u03c6 = \u00d7 = \u2206 \u2206 8.0 0.01 0.8 V 10 3 i e R = = = | | 0.8 0.16 A 5 and \u2206 \u2206 q i t = = \u00d7 = \u00d7 0.16 0.01 1.6 C 10 3 \u2013 (b) \u2206t = 0.02s \u2234 | | \u2013 \u2013 e t B = \u03c6 = \u00d7 = \u2206 \u2206 8.0 0.02 0.4 V 10 3 i e R = = = | | 0.4 0.08 A 5 and \u2206 \u2206 q i t = = ( ) ( ) 0.08 0.02 = \u00d7 1.6 C 10 3 \u2013 Note Time interval \u2206t in part (b) is two times the time interval in part (a), so e and i are half while \u2206q is same.

However, that direction is most easily determined with the help of Lenz\u2019s law. This law states that: \u201cThe direction of any magnetic induction effect is such as to oppose the cause of the effect.\u201d For different types of problems, Lenz\u2019s law has been further subdivided into following concepts. 1. Attraction and repulsion concept If magnetic flux is changed by bringing a magnet and a loop (or solenoid etc.) closer to each other then direction of induced current is so produced, that the magnetic field produced by it always repels the two. Similarly, if they are moved away from each other then they are attracted towards each other. Following two examples will illustrate this. V Example 27.4 A bar magnet is freely falling along the axis of a circular loop as shown in figure. State whether its acceleration a is equal to, greater than or less than the acceleration due to gravity g. Solution a g < . Because according to Lenz\u2019s law, whatever may be the direction of induced current, it will oppose the cause. Here, the cause is, the free fall of magnet and so the induced current will oppose it and the acceleration of magnet will be less than the acceleration due to gravity g. This can also be explained in a different manner. When the magnet falls downwards with its north pole downwards. The magnetic field lines passing through the coil in the downward direction increase. Since, the induced current opposes this, the upper side of the coil will become north pole, so that field lines of coil\u2019s magnetic field are upwards. Now, like poles repel each other. Hence, a g < . V Example 27.5 A bar magnet is brought near a solenoid as shown in figure. Will the solenoid attract or repel the magnet? Chapter 27 Electromagnetic Induction \u0097 461 S N a Fig. 27.6 S N (a) (b) Fig. 27.7 S N Fig. 27.8  Solution When the magnet is brought near the solenoid, according to Lenz\u2019s law, both repel each other. On the other hand, if the magnet is moved away from the solenoid, it attracts the magnet. When the magnet is brought near the solenoid, the nearer side becomes the same pole and when it is moved away it becomes the opposite pole as shown in figure. It can also be explained by increasing or decreasing field lines as discussed in example 27.4. 2. Cross or dot magnetic field increasing or decreasing concept If cross magnetic field passing through a loop increases then induced current will produce dot magnetic field. Similarly, if dot magnetic field passing through a loop decreases then dot magnetic field is produced by the induced current. Let us take some examples in support of it. V Example 27.6 A circular loop is placed in magnetic field B t = 2 . Find the direction of induced current produced in the loop. Solution B t = 2 , means \u2297magnetic field (or we can also say cross magnetic flux) passing through the loop is increasing. So, induced current will produce dot magnetic field. To produce magnetic field, induced current from our side should be anti-clockwise. V Example 27.7 A rectangular loop is placed to the left of large current carrying straight wire as shown in figure. Current varies with time as I t = 2 . Find direction of induced current Iin in the square loop. Solution Current I will produce magnetic field passing through the loop. Current I is increasing, so dot magnetic field will also increase. Therefore, induced current should produce cross magnetic field. For producing cross magnetic field in the loop, induced current from our side should be clockwise. 3. Situations where flux passing through the loop is always zero or change in flux is zero. 462 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism S N N S S N S N Fig. 27.9 x x x x x x x x x Fig. 27.10 I t = 2 Fig. 27.11  V Example 27.8 A current carrying straight wire passes inside a triangular loop as shown in Fig. 27.12. The current in the wire is perpendicular to paper inwards. Find the direction of the induced current in the loop if current in the wire is increased. Solution Magnetic field lines round the current carrying wire are as shown in Fig.27.13. Since, the lines are tangential to the loop ( ) \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 the flux passing through the loop is always zero, whether the current is increased or decreased. Hence, change in flux is also zero. Therefore, induced current in the loop will be zero. . V Example 27.9 A rectangular loop is placed adjacent to a current carrying straight wire as shown in figure. If the loop is rotated about an axis passing through one of its sides, find the direction of induced current in the loop. Solution Magnetic field lines around the straight wire are circular. So, same magnetic lines will pass through loop under all conditions. \u2206\u03c6 = 0 \u21d2 emf = 0 \u21d2 i = 0 4. Attraction or repulsion between two loops facing each other if current in one loop is changed Chapter 27 Electromagnetic Induction \u0097 463 Fig. 27.13 i \u03c9 Fig. 27.14 i Fig. 27.12  V Example 27.10 Two loops are facing each other as shown in Fig. 27.15. State whether the loops will attract each other or repel each other if current I1 is increased. Solution If current I1 is increased then induced current in loop-2 (say I 2) will be in opposite direction. Now, two wires having currents in opposite directions repel each other. So, the loops will repel each other. 1. Figure shows a conducting loop placed near a long straight wire carrying a currenti as shown. If the current increases continuously, find the direction of the induced current in the loop. 2. A metallic loop is placed in a non-uniform steady magnetic field. Will an emf be induced in the loop? 3. Write the dimensions of d dt B \u03c6 . 4. A triangular loop is placed in a dot magnetic field as shown in figure. Find the direction of induced current in the loop if magnetic field is increasing. 5. Two circular loops lie side by side in the same plane. One is connected to a source that supplies an increasing current, the other is a simple closed ring. Is the induced current in the ring is in the same direction as that in the loop connected to the source or opposite? What if the current in the first loop is decreasing? 6. A wire in the form of a circular loop of radius 10 cm lies in a plane normal to a magnetic field of 100 T. If this wire is pulled to take a square shape in the same plane in 0.1 s, find the average induced emf in the loop. 7. A closed coil consists of 500 turns has area4 cm2 and a resistance of50 \u2126. The coil is kept with its plane perpendicular to a uniform magnetic field of 0.2 Wb/m2. Calculate the amount of charge flowing through the coil if it is rotated through 180\u00b0. 8.

How much flux passes through a 5.0 cm2 area loop in this region if the loop lies flat on the xy -plane? 464 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 27.1 i Fig. 27.16 Fig. 27.17 1 2 ",

In this section, we describe what is called motional emf, which is the emf induced in a conductor moving through a constant magnetic field. The straight conductor of length l shown in figure is moving through a uniform magnetic field directed into the page. For simplicity we assume that the conductor is moving in a direction perpendicular to the field with constant velocity under the influence of some external agent. The electrons in the conductor experience a force F v B m e = \u00d7 \u2013 ( ) Under the influence of this force, the electrons move to the lower end of the conductor and accumulate there, leaving a net positive charge at the upper end. As a result of this charge separation, an electric field is produced inside the conductor. The charges accumulate at both ends untill the downward magnetic force evB is balanced by the upward electric force eE. At this point, electrons stop moving. The condition for equilibrium requires that, eE evB = or E vB = The electric field produced in the conductor (once the electrons stop moving and E is constant) is related to the potential difference across the ends of the conductor according to the relationship, \u2206V El Blv = = \u2206V Blv = where the upper end is at a higher electric potential than the lower end. Thus, \u201ca potential difference is maintained between the ends of a straight conductor as long as the conductor continues to move through the uniform magnetic field.\u201d Now, suppose the moving rod slides along a stationary U-shaped conductor forming a complete circuit. We call this a motional electromagnetic force denoted by e, we can write e Bvl = If R is the resistance of the circuit, then current in the circuit is i e R Bvl R = = V V a b > . Therefore, direction of current in the loop is anti-clockwise as shown in figure.

Stretch your right hand. The stretched fingers point in the direction of magnetic field. Thumb is along the velocity of conductor. The upper side of the palm is at higher potential and lower side on lower potential. If the circuit is closed, the induced current within the conductor is along perpendicular to palm upwards. \u0098 In the Fig. 27.20, we can replace the moving rod ab by a battery of emf Bvl with the positive terminal at a and the negative terminal at b. The resistance r of the rod ab may be treated as the internal resistance of the battery. Hence, the current in the circuit is i e R r = + or i Bvl R r = + \u0098 Induction and energy transfers In the Fig. 27.21, if you move the conductor ab with a constant velocity v, the current in the circuit is i Bvl R = ( ) r = 0 A magnetic force F ilB B l v R m = = 2 2 acts on the conductor in opposite direction of velocity. So, to move the conductor with a constant velocity v an equal and opposite force F has to be applied in the conductor. Thus, F F B l v R m = = 2 2 The rate at which work is done by the applied force is P Fv B l v R applied = = 2 2 2 466 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism v a b R l R e Bv = l i \u21d2 r Fig. 27.21 Stretched fingers ( ) B Induced current (Upper side of palm) Velocity of conductor (Thumb) Fig. 27.20 Extra Points to Remember F, v a b R l Fm Fig. 27.22  and the rate at which energy is dissipated in the circuit is P i R Bvl R R B l v R dissipated = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = 2 2 2 2 2 This is just equal to the rate at which work is done by the applied force. \u0098 Motional emf is not a different kind of induced emf, it is exactly the induced emf described by Faraday\u2019s law, in the case in which there is a conductor moving in a magnetic field. Equation, e d dt B = \u03c6 \u2013 is best applied to problems in which there is a changing flux through a closed loop while e Bvl = is applied to problems in which a conductor moves through a magnetic field. Note that, if a conductor is moving in a magnetic field but circuit is not closed, then only PD will be asked between two points of the conductor. If the circuit is closed, then current will be asked in the circuit. Now, let us see how these two are similar. Refer figure (a) A loop abcd enters a uniform magnetic field B at constant speed v. Using Faraday\u2019s equation, | | \u2013 ( ) e d dt d BS dt B = \u03c6 = = = = d Blx dt Bldx dt Blv ( ) For the direction of current, we can use Lenz\u2019s law. As the loop enters the field, \u2297magnetic field passing through the loop increases, hence, induced current should produce magnetic field or current in the loop is anti-clockwise. From the theory of motional emf, e Bvl = and using right hand rule also, current in the circuit is anti-clockwise. Thus, we see that e d dt B = \u03c6 \u2013 and e Bvl = give the same result. In the similar manner, we can show that current in the loop in figure (b) is zero and in figure (c) it is clockwise. \u0098 We can generalize the concept of motional emf for a conductor with any shape moving in any magnetic field uniform or not. For an element dl of conductor the contribution de to the emf is the magnitude dl multiplied by the component of v B \u00d7 parallel to dl, that is de d = \u00d7 \u22c5 ( ) v B l For any two points a and b the motional emf in the direction from b to a is, e d b a = \u00d7 \u22c5 \u222b( ) v B l Chapter 27 Electromagnetic Induction \u0097 467 (b) (a) v a b c d x l (c) v a b c d x v a b c d i = 0 Fig. 27.23 v b c a \u21d2 v b c a v v \u22a5= cos \u03b8 \u03b8 Fig. 27.24  In general, we can say that motional emf in wire acb in a uniform magnetic field is the motional emf in an imaginary straight wire ab. Thus, e e ab v B acb ab = = \u22a5 ( )( )( ) length of Here, v\u22a5is the component of velocity perpendicular to both B and ab. From right hand rule we can see that b is at higher potential and a at lower potential. Hence, V V V ab v B ba b a = = \u2013 ( )( cos )( ) \u03b8 \u0098 Motional emf induced in a rotating bar : A conducting rod of length l rotates with a constant angular speed \u03c9 about a pivot at one end. A uniform magnetic field B is directed perpendicular to the plane of rotation as shown in figure. Consider a segment of rod of lengthdr at a distance r from O. This segment has a velocity, v r = \u03c9 The induced emf in this segment is de Bvdr B r dr = = ( ) \u03c9 Summing the emfs induced across all segments, which are in series, gives the total emf across the rod. \u2234 e de Br dr B l l l = = = \u222b \u222b 0 2 0 2 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u2234 e B l = \u03c9 2 2 From right hand rule we can see that P is at higher potential than O. Thus, V V B l P O \u2013 = \u03c9 2 2 \u0098 Note that in the problems of electromagnetic induction whenever you see a conductor moving in a magnetic field use the motional approach. It is easier than the other approach. But, if the conductor (or loop) is stationary, you have no choice.

When a current is present in the circuit, it sets up a magnetic field that causes a magnetic flux through the same circuit. This flux changes as the current in the circuit is changed. According to Faraday\u2019s law any change in flux in a circuit produces an induced emf in it. Such an emf is called a self-induced emf. The name is so called because the source of this induced emf is the change of current in the same circuit. According to Lenz\u2019s law the self-induced emf always opposes the change in the current that caused the emf and so tends to make it more difficult for variations in current to occur. We will here like to define a term self-inductance L of a circuit which is of great importance in our proceeding discussions. It can be defined in the following two ways : First Definition Suppose a circuit includes a coil with N turns of wire. It carries a current i. The total flux ( ) ",

This constant is called self-inductance. Thus, N Li B \u03c6 = or L N i B = \u03c6 From here we can define self-inductance ( ) L of any circuit as, the total flux per unit current. The SI unit of self-inductance is henry (1H). Second Definition If a current iis passed in a circuit and it is changed with a rate di dt / , the induced emf e produced in the circuit is directly proportional to the rate of change of current. Thus, e di dt \u221d When the proportionality constant is removed, the same constant L again comes here. Hence, e L di dt = \u2013 The minus sign here is a reflection of Lenz\u2019s law. It says that the self-induced emf in a circuit opposes any change in the current in that circuit. From the above equation, L e di dt = \u2013 / This equation states that, the self-inductance of a circuit is the magnitude of self induced emf per unit rate of change of current. A circuit or part of a circuit, that is designed to have a particular inductance is called an inductor. The usual symbol for an inductor is Thus, an inductor is a circuit element which opposes the change in current through it. It may be a circular coil, solenoid etc. 472 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism Fig. 27.32  Significance of Self-inductance and Inductor Like capacitors and resistors, inductors are among the circuit elements of modern electronics. Their purpose is to oppose any variations in the current through the circuit. In a DC circuit, an inductor helps to maintain a steady state current despite fluctuations in the applied emf. In an AC circuit, an inductor tends to suppress variations of the current that are more rapid than desired. An inductor plays a dormant role in a circuit so far as current is constant. It becomes active when current changes in the circuit. Every inductor has some self-inductance which depends on the size, shape and the number of turns etc. For N turns close together, it is always proportional to N 2. It also depends on the magnetic properties of the material enclosed by the circuit. When the current passing through it is changed, an emf of magnitude L di dt / is induced across it. Later in this article, we will explore the method of finding the self-inductance of an inductor. Potential Difference Across an Inductor We can find the polarities of self-induced emf across an inductor from Lenz\u2019s law. The induced emf is produced whenever there is a change in the current in the inductor. This emf always acts to oppose this change. Figure shows three cases. Assume that the inductor has negligible resistance, so the PD, V V V ab a b = \u2013 between the inductor terminals a and b is equal in magnitude to the self-induced emf. Refer figure (a) The current is constant, and there is no self-induced emf. Hence, Vab = 0 Refer figure (b) The current is increasing, so di dt is positive. The induced emf e must oppose the increasing current, so it must be in the sense from b to a, a becomes the higher potential terminal andVab is positive. The direction of the emf is analogous to a battery with a as its positive terminal. Refer figure (c) The current is decreasing and di dt is negative. The self-induced emf eopposes this decrease andVab is negative. This is analogous to a battery with b as its positive terminal. In each case, we can write the PD,Vab as V e L di dt ab = = \u2013 The circuit\u2019s behaviour of an inductor is quite different from that of a resistor. While a resistor opposes the current i, an inductor opposes the change ( / ) di dt in the current.

For example in the loop shown in figure, Kirchhoff\u2019s second law gives the equation. E iR L di dt \u2013 \u2013 = 0 V Example 27.13 The inductor shown in the figure has inductance 0.54 H and carries a current in the direction shown that is decreasing at a uniform rate di dt A/s = \u2013 0.03 .

(b) V L di dt ba = = \u00d7 \u2013 \u2013 1.62 V 10 2 Since,V V V ba b a ( \u2013 ) = is negative. It implies thatV V a b > or a is at higher potential. Ans.

Note As the current is decreasing, the inductor can be replaced by a source of emf e L di dt V = \u22c5 = 5 in such a manner that this emf supports the decreasing current, or it sends the current in the circuit in the same direction as the existing current. So, positive terminal of this source is towards b. Thus, the given circuit can be drawn as shown below, Now, we can find Vab. Method of Finding Self-inductance of a Circuit We use the equation, L N i B = \u03c6 / to calculate the inductance of given circuit. A good approach for calculating the self-inductance of a circuit consists of the following steps: (a) Assume that there is a current i flowing through the circuit (we can call the circuit as inductor). (b) Determine the magnetic field B produced by the current. (c) Obtain the magnetic flux \u03c6B. (d) With the flux known, the self-inductance can be found from L N i B = \u03c6 / . To demonstrate this procedure, we now calculate the self-inductance of two inductors. Inductance of a Solenoid Let us find the inductance of a uniformly wound solenoid having N turns and length l. Assume that lis much longer than the radius of the windings and that the core of the solenoid is air.

Because the magnitude of magnetic field changes within the toroid, we must calculate the flux by integrating over the toroid\u2019s cross-section.

Similarly, an inductor has the capability of storing energy in its magnetic field. An increasing current in an inductor causes an emf between its terminals. The work done per unit time is power. P dW dt ei Li di dt = = = \u2013 \u2013 From dW dU = \u2013 or P dW dt dU dt = = \u2013 We have, dU dt Li di dt = or dU Li di = The total energyU supplied while the current increases from zero to a final value i is U L idi Li i = = \u222b0 2 1 2 \u2234 U Li = 1 2 2 This is the expression for the energy stored in the magnetic field of an inductor when a current i flows through it. The source of this energy is the external source of emf that supplies the current. Note (i) After the current has reached its final steady state value i, di dt / = 0 and no more energy is taken by the inductor. (ii) When the current decreases from i to zero, the inductor acts as a source that supplies a total amount of energy 1 2 2 Li to the external circuit. If we interrupt the circuit suddenly by opening a switch, the current decreases very rapidly, the induced emf is very large and the energy may be dissipated as a spark across the switch. (iii) If we compare the behaviour of a resistor and an inductor towards the current flow we can observe that energy flows into a resistor whenever a current passes through it. Whether the current is steady (constant) or varying this energy is dissipated in the form of heat. By contrast energy flows into an ideal, zero resistance inductor only when the current in the inductor increases. This energy is not dissipated, it is stored in the inductor and released when the current decreases. (iv) As we said earlier also, the energy in an inductor is actually stored in the magnetic field within the coil. We can develop relations of magnetic energy density u (energy stored per unit volume) analogous to those we obtained in electrostatics.

(b) If the current through the solenoid decreases uniformly from 10 A to 0 A in 0.10 s, what is the emf induced between the ends of the solenoid? 27.7 Mutual Inductance We have already discussed in Chapter 26, the magnetic interaction between two wires carrying steady currents. The current in one wire causes a magnetic field, which exerts a force on the current in the second wire. An additional interaction arises between two circuits when there is a changing current in one of the circuits. 480 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism L = 2 H a i b R = 4\u2126 Fig. 27.42 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 27.3 i1 i1 1 2 Fig. 27.43  Consider two neighbouring coils of wire as shown in Fig. 27.42. A current flowing in coil 1 produces magnetic field and hence, a magnetic flux through coil 2. If the current in coil 1 changes, the flux through coil 2 changes as well. According to Faraday\u2019s law this induces an emf in coil 2. In this way, a change in the current in one circuit can induce a current in a second circuit. This phenomenon is known as mutual induction. Like the self-inductance ( ) L , two circuits have mutual inductance ( ) M . It also have two definitions as under: First Definition Suppose the circuit 1 has a current i1 flowing in it. Then, total flux N B 2 2 \u03c6 linked with circuit 2 is proportional to the current in 1. Thus, N i B 2 1 2 \u03c6 \u221d or N Mi B 2 1 2 \u03c6 = Here, the proportionality constant M is known as the mutual inductance M of the two circuits. Thus, M N i B = \u03c6 2 1 2 From this expression, M can be defined as the total flux N B 2 2 \u03c6 linked with circuit 2 per unit current in circuit 1. Second Definition If we change the current in circuit 1 at a rate di dt 1 / , an induced emf e2 is developed in circuit 1, which is proportional to the rate di dt 1 / . Thus, e di dt 2 1 \u221d / or e Mdi dt 2 1 = \u2013 / Here, the proportionality constant is again M. Minus sign indicates that e2 is in such a direction that it opposes any change in the current in circuit 1. From the above equation, M e di dt = \u2013 / 2 1 This equation states that, the mutual inductance of two circuits is the magnitude of induced emf e2 per unit rate of change of current di dt 1 / . Note down the following points regarding the mutual inductance: 1. The SI unit of mutual inductance is henry (1H). 2. M depends upon closeness of the two circuits, their orientations and sizes and the number of turns etc. 3. Reciprocity theorem : M M M 21 12 = = e M di dt 2 1 = \u2013 ( / ) and e M di dt 1 2 = \u2013 ( / ) M N i B 12 2 1 2 = \u03c6 and M N i B 21 1 2 1 = \u03c6 Chapter 27 Electromagnetic Induction \u0097 481  4. A good approach for calculating the mutual inductance of two circuits consists of the following steps: (a) Assume any one of the circuits as primary (first) and the other as secondary (second). (b) Pass a current i1 through the primary circuit. (c) Determine the magnetic field B produced by the current i1. (d) Obtain the magnetic flux \u03c6B2. (e) With this flux, the mutual inductance can be found from, M N i B = \u03c6 2 1 2 Mutual Inductance of a Solenoid Surrounded by a Coil Figure shows a coil of N2 turns and radius R2 surrounding a long solenoid of length l1, radius R1 and number of turns N1. To calculate M between them, let us assume a current i1 in solenoid. There is no magnetic field outside the solenoid and the field inside has magnitude, B N l i = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u00b5 0 1 1 1 and is directed parallel to the solenoid\u2019s axis. The magnetic flux \u03c6B2 through the surrounding coil is, therefore, \u03c6 = = B B R N i l R 2 1 2 0 1 1 1 1 2 ( ) \u03c0 \u00b5 \u03c0 Now, M N i N i N i l R ",

If the resistance of the circuit is zero, no energy is dissipated as heat. We also assume an idealized situation in which energy is not radiated away from the circuit. With these idealizations-zero resistance and no radiation, the oscillations in the circuit persist indefinitely and the energy is transferred from the capacitor\u2019s electric field to the inductor\u2019s magnetic field and back. The total energy associated with the circuit is constant. This is analogous to the transfer of energy in an oscillating mechanical system from potential energy to kinetic energy and back, with constant total energy. Later, we will see that this analogy goes much further. Let us now derive an equation for the oscillations in an L-C circuit. ] Refer figure (a) A capacitor is charged to a PD, V q C 0 0 = Here, q0 is the maximum charge on the capacitor. At time t = 0, it is connected to an inductor through a switch S. At time t = 0, switch S is closed. Refer figure (b) When the switch is closed, the capacitor starts discharging. Let at time t charge on the capacitor is q q ( ) < 0 and since, it is further decreasing there is a current i in the circuit in the direction shown in figure. Later we will see that, as the charge is oscillating there may be a situation when q will be increasing, but in that case direction of current is also reversed and the equation remains unchanged.

Chapter 27 Electromagnetic Induction \u0097 493 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 27.6  27.10 Induced Electric Field When a conductor moves in a magnetic field, we can understand the induced emf on the basis of magnetic forces on charges in the conductor as described in Art. 27.5. But an induced emf also occurs when there is a changing flux through a stationary conductor. What is it that pushes the charges around the circuit in this type of situation? As an example, let\u2019s consider the situation shown in figure. A conducting circular loop is placed in a magnetic field which is directed perpendicular to the paper inwards. When the magnetic field changes with time (suppose it increases with time) the magnetic flux \u03c6B also changes and according to Faraday\u2019s law the induced emf e d dt B = \u03c6 \u2013 is produced in the loop. If the total resistance of the loop is R, the induced current in the loop is given by i e R = But what force makes the charges move around the loop? It can\u2019t be the magnetic force, because the charges are not moving in the magnetic field. Actually, there is an induced electric field in the conductor caused by the changing magnetic flux. This electric field has the following important properties: 1. It is non-conservative in nature. The line integral of E around a closed path is not zero. This line integral is given by E l \u22c5 = \u03c6 \u222b d d dt B \u2013 \u2026(i) Note that this equation is valid only if the path around which we integrate is stationary. 494 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism x x x x x x x x x x x x Fig. 27.54 r E E E E Bin x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x x Fig. 27.55  2. Because of symmetry, the electric field Ehas the same magnitude at every point on the circle and is tangent to it at each point. The directions of Eat several points on the loop are shown in figure. 3. Being a non-conservative field, the concept of potential has no meaning for such a field. 4. This field is different from the electrostatic field produced by stationary charges (which is conservative in nature). 5. The relation F E = q is still valid for this field. 6. This field can vary with time. So, a changing magnetic field acts as a source of electric field of a sort that we cannot produce with any static charge distribution. This may seen strange but its the way nature behaves. Note 1. For symmetrical situations (as shown in figure) Eq. (i), in simplified form can be written as El d dt S dB dt B = \u03c6 = Here, l is the length of closed loop in which electric field is to be calculated and S is the area in which magnetic field is changing. 2. Direction of electric field is the same as the direction of induced current.

Eddy currents When a changing magnetic flux is applied to a piece of conducting material, circulating currents called eddy currents are induced in the material. These eddy currents often have large magnitudes and heat up the conductor. When a metal plate is allowed to swing through a strong magnetic field, then in entering or leaving the field the eddy currents are set up in the plate which opposes the motion as shown in figure. The kinetic energy dissipates in the form of heat. The slowing down of the plate is called the electromagnetic damping. The electromagnetic damping is used to damp the oscillations of a galvanometer coil or chemical balance and in braking electric trains. Otherwise, the eddy currents are often undesirable. To reduce the eddy currents some slots are cut into moving metallic parts of machinery. These slots intercept the conducting paths and decreases the magnitudes of the induced currents. 2. Back EMF of Motors An electric motor converts electrical energy into mechanical energy and is based on the fact that a current carrying coil in a uniform magnetic field experiences a torque. As the coil rotates in the magnetic field, the flux linked with the rotating coil will change and hence, an emf called back emf is  produced in the coil. When the motor is first turned on, the coil is at rest and so there is no back emf. The \u2018start up\u2019 current can be quite large. To reduce \u2018start up\u2019 current a resistance called \u2018starter\u2019 is put in series with the motor for a short period when the motor is started. As the rotation rate increases the back emf increases and hence, the current reduces. 3. Electric Generator or Dynamo A dynamo converts mechanical energy (rotational kinetic energy) into electrical energy. It consists of a coil rotating in a magnetic field. Due to rotation of the coil magnetic flux linked with it changes, so an emf is induced in the coil.

A transformer consists of two coils wound on the same core. The coil connected to input is called primary while the other connected to output is called secondary coil. An alternating current passing through the primary creates a continuously changing flux through the core. This changing flux induces an alternating emf in the secondary.

Hence, induced current in an imaginary loop passing through a and b should produce u magnetic field. Hence, induced current through an imaginary circular loop passing through a and b should be anti-clockwise. Force on positive charge is in the direction of induced current. Hence, force at a is towards left and force at b is upwards. Type 6. Based on motion of a wire in uniform magnetic field with other element like resistance, capacitor or an inductor Concept A constant force F is applied on wire PQ of length l and mass m. There is an electrical element X in the box as shown in figure. There are the following three different cases : Case 1 If X is a resistance, then velocity of the wire increases exponentially. Case 2 If X is a capacitor, then wire moves with a constant acceleration a ( / ) < F m . Case 3 If X is an inductor and instead of constant force F an initial velocity v0 is given to the wire then the wire starts simple harmonic motion with v0 as the maximum velocity ( ) = \u03c9A at mean position. V Example 14 In the above case if X is a resistance R, then find velocity of wire as a function of time t.

The rod is given an initial velocity v0 to the right and is released at t = 0. Find as a function of time, (a) the velocity of the rod (b) the induced current and (c) the magnitude of the induced emf. v0 a b R l Miscellaneous Examples  HOW TO PROCEED The initial velocity will produce an induced emf and hence, an induced current in the circuit. The current carrying wire will now experience a magnetic force ( ) Fm in opposite direction of its velocity. The force will retard the motion of the conductor. Thus, Initial velocity \u2192motional emf \u2192induced current \u2192magnetic force \u2192retardation. Solution (a) Let v be the velocity of the rod at time t. Current in the circuit at this moment is i Bvl R = \u2026(i) From right hand rule, we can see that this current is in counterclockwise direction. The magnetic force is, F ilB B l R v m = = \u2013 \u2013 2 2 Here, negative sign denotes that the force is to the left and retards the motion. This is the only horizontal force acting on the bar, and hence, Newton\u2019s second law applied to motion in horizontal direction gives m dv dt F B l R v m = = \u2013 2 2 \u2234 dv v B l mR dt = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u2013 2 2 Integrating this equation using the initial condition that, v v = 0 at t = 0, we find that dv v B l mR dt v v t 0 2 2 0 \u222b \u222b = \u2013 Solving this equation, we find that v v e t = 0 \u2013 / \u03c4 \u2026(ii) Ans. where, \u03c4 = mR B l 2 2 This expression indicates that the velocity of the rod decreases exponentially with time under the action of the magnetic retarding force. (b) i Bvl R = Substituting the value of v from Eq. (ii), we get i Blv R e t = 0 \u2013 / \u03c4 Ans. (c) e iR Blv e t = = 0 \u2013 / \u03c4 Ans. i and e both decrease exponentially with time. v t- , i t- and e t- graphs are as shown in figure 520 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism v i R Fm B a b v t v0 i e t t B v R l 0 B vl 0  Alternate solution This problem can also be solved by energy conservation principle.

At the moment t = 0, the loop is set into rotation with a constant angular acceleration \u03b1 about an axis O coinciding with a line of vector B on the boundary. Find the emf induced in the loop as a function of time. Draw the approximate plot of this function. The arrow in the figure shows the emf direction taken to be positive.

Thomas Edison favoured direct current (DC), that is, steady current that does not vary with time. George Westinghouse favoured alternating current (AC), with sinusoidally varying voltages and currents. He argued that transformers can be used to step the voltage up or down with AC but not with DC. Low voltages are safer for consumer use, but high voltages and correspondingly low currents are best for long distances power transmission to minimize i R 2 losses in the cables. Eventually, Westinghouse prevailed, and most present day household and industrial power distribution systems operate with alternating current. A time varying current or voltage may be periodic and non-periodic. In case of periodic current or voltage, the current or voltage is said to be alternating if its amplitude is constant and alternate half cycle is positive and half negative. If the current or voltage varies periodically as sine or cosine function of time, the current or voltage is said to be sinusoidal and is what we usually mean by it. 28.2 Alternating Currents and Phasors The basic principle of the AC generator is a direct consequence of Faraday's law of induction. When a conducting loop is rotated in a magnetic field at constant angular frequency \u03c9 a sinusoidal voltage (emf) is induced in the loop. This instantaneous voltage is V V t = 0 sin \u03c9 \u2026(i) The usual circuit diagram symbol for an AC source is shown in Fig. 28.2. In Eq. (i),V0 is the maximum output voltage of the AC generator or the voltage amplitude and \u03c9 is the angular frequency equal to 2\u03c0 times the frequency f. \u03c9 \u03c0 = 2 f The frequency of AC in India is 50 Hz, i.e. f = 50 Hz So, \u03c9 \u03c0 = \u2248 2 314 f rad/s The time of one cycle is known as time period T, the number of cycles per second the frequency f. T f = 1 or T = 2\u03c0 \u03c9 562 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism + + \u2013 \u2013 t i V or t i V or i i t V V t = sin or = sin 0 0 \u03c9 \u03c9 i i t V V t = cos or = cos 0 0 \u03c9 \u03c9 V i 0 0 , \u2013i0 \u2013V0 + Fig. 28.1 Fig. 28.2  A sinusoidal current might be described as i i t = 0 sin \u03c9 If an alternating current is passed through an ordinary ammeter or voltmeter, it will record the mean value for the complete cycle, as the quantity to be measured varies with time. The average value of current for one cycle is i i idt dt T T T One cycle av = = \u222b \u222b ( ) 0 0 = = \u222b \u222b ( sin ) / i t dt dt 0 2 0 2 0 \u03c9 0 \u03c0/\u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c9 Thus, i One cycle = 0 Similarly, the average value of the voltage (or emf) for one cycle is zero. V One cycle = 0 Since, these averages for the whole cycle are zero, the DC instrument will indicate zero deflection. In AC, the average value of current is defined as its average taken over half the cycle. Hence, i i idt dt i t dt T T T Half cycle av = = = \u222b \u222b ( ) ( sin ) / / / / 2 0 2 0 2 0 0 \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c9 0 \u03c0/\u03c9 \u03c0 \u222b \u222b = dt i 2 0 This is sometimes simply written as iav . Hence, i i i i av Half cycle 0 0 0.637 = = \u2248 2 \u03c0 Similarly, V V V av 0.637 = \u2248 2 0 0 \u03c0 A DC meter can be used in an AC circuit if it is connected in the full wave rectifier circuit. The average value of the rectified current is the same as the average current in any half cycle, i.e. 2 \u03c0 times the maximum current i0. A more useful way to describe a quantity is the root mean square (rms) value. We square the instantaneous current, take the average (mean) value of i2 and finally take the square root of that average. This procedure defines the root-mean-square current denoted as irms. Even when i is negative, i2 is always positive so irms is never zero (unless i is zero at every instant). Hence, i i dt dt T T 2 2 0 0 One cycle = \u222b \u222b = = \u222b \u222b ( sin ) / / i t dt dt i 0 2 2 0 2 0 2 0 2 2 \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c9 \u2234 i i i i rms One cycle 0.707 = = \u2248 2 0 0 2 Thus, i i i rms 0.707 = \u2248 0 0 2 Chapter 28 Alternating Current \u0097 563  Similarly, we get V V V rms 0.707 = \u2248 0 0 2 The square root of the mean square value is called the virtual value and is the value given by AC instruments. Thus, when we speak of our house hold power supply as 220 V AC, this means that the rms voltage is 220 V and its voltage amplitude is V V 0 2 311 = = rms V Form Factor The ratio, = = rms value average value V V 0 0 2 2 / /\u03c0 = = \u03c0 2 2 1.11 is known as form factor. The different values i0, iav and irms are shown in Fig. 28.3. Note (1) The average value of sin\u03c9t, cos \u03c9t, sin2\u03c9t, cos 2\u03c9t, etc., is zero because it is positive in half of the time and negative in rest half of the time. Thus, sin cos sin cos \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 t t t t = = = = 2 2 0 If i i t = 0 sin\u03c9 then i i t i t = = = 0 0 0 sin sin \u03c9 \u03c9 (2) The average value of sin2 \u03c9t and cos2 \u03c9t is 1 2 \u22c5 or sin cos 2 2 1 2 \u03c9 \u03c9 t t = = If i i t 2 0 2 2 = sin \u03c9 then i i t i t i 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 0 2 2 = = = sin sin \u03c9 \u03c9 (3) Like SHM, general expressions of current/voltage in an sinusoidal AC are i i t = \u00b1 \u03c6 0 sin ( ) \u03c9 V V t = \u00b1 \u03c6 0 sin ( ) \u03c9 or i i t = \u00b1 \u03c6 0 cos ( ) \u03c9 and V V t = \u00b1 \u03c6 0 cos ( ) \u03c9 (4) Average value of current or voltage over a half cycle can be zero also. This depends on the time interval (of course T /2) over which average value is to be found. Think why? Phasors If an AC generator is connected to a series circuit containing resistors, inductors and capacitors and we want to know the amplitude and time characteristics of the alternating current. To simplify our analysis of circuits containing two or more elements, we use graphical constructions called phasor diagrams. In these constructions, alternating (sinusoidal) quantities, such as current and voltage are rotating vectors called phasors. In these diagrams, the instantaneous value of a quantity that varies sinusoidally with time is represented by the projection onto a vertical axis (if it is a sine function) or onto a horizontal axis (if it 564 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism i 0 i i rms = 0.707 0 iav = 0.637 0i i t Fig. 28.3  is a cosine function) of a vector with a length equal to the amplitude ( ) i0 of the quantity. The vector rotates counterclockwise with constant angular velocity \u03c9. A phasor is not a real physical quantity with a direction in space, such as velocity, momentum or electric field. Rather, it is a geometric entity that helps us to describe and analyze physical quantities that vary sinusoidally with time.

We will consider resistors, inductors and capacitors. Resistor in an AC Circuit Consider a resistor with resistance R through which there is a sinusoidal current given by i i t = 0 sin\u03c9 \u2026(i) Here, i0 is the current amplitude (maximum current). From Ohm's law, the instantaneous PD between points a and b is V iR R = = ( ) sin i R t 0 \u03c9 We can write as i R V 0 0 = , the voltage amplitude \u2234 V V t R = 0 sin\u03c9 \u2026(ii) From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we can see that current and voltage are in phase if only resistance is in the circuit. Fig. 28.6 shows graphs of i andVR as functions of time. The corresponding phasor diagram is shown in Fig. 28.7. Because i andVR are in phase and have the same frequency, the current and voltage phasors rotate together, they are parallel at each instant. Their projection on vertical axis represents the instantaneous current and voltage respectively. Note Direction of an alternating current is not shown in a circuit, as it keeps on changing. In the figure, the direction of instantaneous current is only shown.

This expression gives the correct sign of VL in all cases. \u0098 If an oscillating voltage of a given amplitude V0 is applied across an inductor, the resulting current will have a smaller amplitude i0 for larger value of\u03c9. Since, XL is proportional to frequency, a high frequency voltage applied to the inductor gives only a small current while a lower frequency voltage of the same amplitude gives rise to a larger current. Inductors are used in some circuit applications, such as power supplies and radio interference filters to block high frequencies while permitting lower frequencies to pass through. A circuit device that uses an inductor for this purpose is called a low pass filter. \u0098 The capacitive reactance of a capacitor is inversely proportional to the capacitance C and the angular frequency \u03c9. The greater the capacitance and the higher the frequency, the smaller is the capacitive reactance XC. Capacitors tend to pass high frequency current and to block low frequency current, just the opposite of inductors. A device that passes signals of high frequency is called a high pass filter. \u0098 Figure shows the graphs of R XL , and XC as functions of angular frequency \u03c9. \u0098 Remember that we can write, V R R = i , ( ) V R R 0 0 = i , ( ) V X L L 0 0 = i and ( ) V X C C 0 0 = i but can't write (for instantaneous voltages). V X L L = i or V X C C = i This is because there is a phase difference between the voltage and current in both an inductor and a capacitor.

Such coplanar vectors which represent sinusoidally time varying quantities are known as phasors. In Cartesian form, a phasor A can be written as A = + a jb where, a is the x-component and b is the y-component of phasor A. The magnitude of A is | | A = + a b 2 2 and the angle between the direction of phasor A and the positive x-axis is \u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 tan \u20131 b a When a given phasor A, the direction of which is along the x-axis is multiplied by the operator j, a new phasor jA is obtained which will be 90\u00b0 anti-clockwise from A, i.e. along y-axis. If the operator j is multiplied now to the phasor jA, a new phasor j2A is obtained which is along \u2013x-axis and having same magnitude as of A. Thus, j2A A = \u2013 \u2234 j2 1 = \u2013 or j = \u20131 Now, using the j operator, let us discuss different circuits of an AC. 28.5 Series L-R Circuit As we know, potential difference across a resistance in AC is in phase with current and it leads in phase by 90\u00b0 with current across the inductor. Suppose in phasor diagram current is taken along positive x-direction. Then,VR is also along positive x-direction andVL along positive y-direction, so, we can write 570 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism \u03b8 b A a y x Fig. 28.16 ",

So, we cannot use P Vi = for the power generated. Suppose in an AC, the voltage is leading the current by an angle \u03c6. Then, we can write V V t = 0 sin\u03c9 and i i t = \u03c6 0 sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 The instantaneous value of power in that case is P Vi V i t t = = \u03c6 0 0 sin sin ( \u2013 ) \u03c9 \u03c9 or P V i t t = \u03c6 \u03c6 \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa 0 0 2 1 2 sin cos \u2013 sin sin \u03c9 \u03c9 2 \u2026(i) Now, the average rate of doing work (power) in one cycle will be P Pdt dt T T One cycle = = = \u222b \u222b 0 2 0 2 \u03c0 \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c9 / / \u2026(ii) 576 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 28.1  Substituting the value of P from Eq. (i) in Eq. (ii) and then integrating it with proper limits, we get P V i V i One cycle = \u03c6 = \u22c5 \u03c6 1 2 2 2 0 0 0 0 cos cos or P V i One cycle rms rms = \u03c6 cos Here, the term cos\u03c6 is known as power factor. It is said to be leading if current leads voltage, lagging if current lags voltage. Thus, a power factor of 0.5 lagging means current lags the voltage by 60\u00b0 (as cos \u20131 60 0.5 = \u00b0). The product ofVrms and irms gives the apparent power. While the true power is obtained by multiplying the apparent power by the power factor cos\u03c6. Thus, Apparent power = \u00d7 V i rms rms and True power = apparent power \u00d7 power factor For \u03c6 = \u00b0 0 , the current and voltage are in phase. The power is thus, maximum (= \u00d7 V i rms rms). For \u03c6 = \u00b0 90 , the power is zero. The current is then stated wattless. Such a case will arise when resistance in the circuit is zero. The circuit is purely inductive or capacitive. The case is similar to that of a frictionless pendulum, where the total work done by gravity upon the pendulum in a cycle is zero. Let us consider a choke coil (used in tube lights) of large inductance L and low resistance R. The power factor for such a coil is given by cos\u03c6 = = + R Z R R L 2 2 2 \u03c9 \u2248R L \u03c9 (as R L << \u03c9 ) As R L << \u03c9 , cos\u03c6 is very small. Thus, the power absorbed by the coil Vrms irms cos\u03c6 is very small. On account of its large impedance Z R L = + 2 2 2 \u03c9 , the current passing through the coil is very small. Such a coil is used in AC circuits for the purpose of adjusting current to any required value without waste of energy. The only loss of energy is due to hysteresis in the iron core, which is much less than the loss of energy in the resistance that can also reduce the current instead of a choke coil. V Example 28.7 ",

(c) The capacitor is replaced by one with C F = 0.0360 \u00b5 and the source frequency is adjusted to the new resonance value. Then, what is the average power delivered by the source?

An arc lamp consumes 10 A at 40 V. Calculate the power factor when it is connected with a suitable value of choke coil required to run the arc lamp on AC mains of 200 V (rms) and 50 Hz. 578 \u0097 Electricity and Magnetism INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 28.2  Final Touch Points 1. Frequency of AC in India is 50 Hz. 2. The AC is converted into DC with the help of rectifier while DC is converted into AC with the help of inverter. 3. An AC cannot produce electroplating or electrolysis. 4. The AC is measured by hot wire ammeter. 5. An AC can be stepped up or down with the help of a transformer. 6. An AC can be transmitted over long distances without much power loss. 7. An AC can be regulated by using choke coil without any significant waste of energy. 8. In an AC (sinusoidal), current or voltage can have the following four values (i) instantaneous value (ii) peak value (i 0 orV0) (iii) rms value (irms orVrms) (iv) average value : In full cycle, average value is zero while in half cycle it is non-zero. Note That in sinusoidal AC the average value in half cycle can also be zero. It depends on the time interval over which half average value is desired. 9. In an series L-C-R circuit, (i) Capacitive reactance, X C C = 1 \u03c9 (ii) Inductive reactance, X L L = \u03c9 (iii) Impedance, Z R X X C L = + \u2212 2 2 ( ) (iv) If X X C L > , current leads and if X X L C > , voltage leads by an angle \u03c6 given by cos \u03c6 = R Z and tan ~ \u03c6 = X X R C L (v) Instantaneous power = instantaneous current \u00d7 instantaneous voltage (vi) Average power = \u03c6 V i rms rms cos , where cos \u03c6 = = R Z power factor. Note Power is also equal to P i R rms = 2 But this is not equal to P V R rms \u2260 2 This is because V i Z rms rms = and cos . \u03c6 = R Z If we substitute in P V i rms rms = \u03c6 cos , then we get the first relation but not the second one. This implies that power is consumed only across resistance. (vii) i V Z 0 0 = or i V Z rms rms = (viii) ( ) ( ) , ( ) ( ) V i X V i X C C L L rms rms rms rms = = and ( ) ( ) V i R R rms rms = (ix) V V V V R C L = + 2 2 ( ~ ) Here, V is the rms value of applied voltage VR is the rms value of voltage across resistance.

At stable equilibrium position, potential energy is minimum. 8. In uniform electric field, net force on an electric dipole = 0 Therefore, no work is done in translational motion of the dipole. Electric lines also flow from higher potential to lower potential. Electrostatical force on positive charge acts in the direction of electric field. Therefore, work done is positive. 9. Charge on shell does not contribute in electric field just inside the shell. But it contributes in the electric field just outside it.

Then, from B to C kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases. 10. Over Q1, potential is + \u03b1. Hence, Q1 is positive. VA = 0 and A point is nearer to Q2. Therefore, Q2 should be negative and | | | | Q Q 1 2 > . At A and B, potential is zero, not the force. Equilibrium at C will depend on the nature of charge which is kept at C.

Higher force = 2qE (towards left) If we displace the rod, \u03c4 \u03c4 1 2 = or \u03c4net = 0 in displaced position too. Hence, equilibrium is neutral. 10. Along the line AB, charge q is at unstable equilibrium position at B (When displaced from B along AB, net force on it is away from B, whereas force at B is zero). Hence, potential energy at B is maximum. Along CD equilibrium of q is stable. Hence, potential energy at B is minimum along CD. Comprehension Based Questions 1.

(a) Point a lies to the right hand side of ef and fg. Hence, both wires produce inward magnetic field. Hence, net magnetic field is inwards. Same logic can be applied for other points also. 10.

(b) Same logic is given in (a). (c) B is parallel to v. So, magnetic force is zero. Charge is negative so, electric force is opposite to E. (d) Charge is negative. So, electrostate force is in opposite direction of E. 2. For direction of magnetic force apply Fleming\u2019s left hand rule. According to that w and x are positively charged particles and yand z negatively charged particle. Secondly, r Km Bq = 2 \u2234 r m q \u221d (K \u2192same) 3.

In steady state, whole current passes through the inductor. 29. If current is passed through the straight wire, magnetic lines are circular and tangential to the loop. So, no flux is linked with the loop. 30. In second position, \u2206\u03c6 = 0 \u2234 | | Q R 2 0 = = \u2206\u03c6 31. From Lenz's law,  induced effects always oppose the cause due to which they are produced. So, when the first loop is moved towards the smaller loop, it will face repulsion. 32. \u03c4L L R = = 2 s i E R 0 3 = = A , t = 2 s i i e t L = \u2212 \u2212 0 1( ) / \u03c4 Substituting the given values, we can find i. 33. In AB, l is parallel to its v. Hence, PD = 0 34. v is parallel to l. 35. For wire ab, velocity vector is parallel to l. 36. Current increases with time. So, flux passing through B will increase with time. From Lenz's law, it should have a tendency to move away from the coil to decrease flux. 37. For E \u22600, \u03c6 must change or d dt \u03c6 \u22600 38. Even if radius is doubled, flux is not going to change. 39. B | | is parallel to MN (or l) and B\u22a5is parallel or antiparallel to velocity. Subjective Questions 1. When switch is opened current suddenly decreasing from steady state value to zero. When switch is closed, it takes time to increase from 0 to steady state value. e L i t = \u2206 \u2206 \u2206t in second case is large. Hence, induced emf is less. 2. e N t ",

So, induced current is zero. 5. At t = 0, inductor offers infinite resistance. Hence, current through inductor wire is zero.

It can be transported either directly with a cable of large current carrying capacity or by using a combination of step-up and step-down transformers at the two ends.

At the consumers\u2019 end a step-down transformer is used to supply power to the consumers at the specified lower voltage.

On reaching negative plate, balls will attain negative charge and come back to positive plate. and so on, balls will keep oscillating. But oscillation is not S.H.M., As force on balls is not \u221dx. \u21d2option (d) is correct. 23. (a) As the balls keep on carrying charge form one plate to another, current will keep on flowing even in steady state.

(c,d) Because of non-uniform evaporation at different section, area of cross-section would be different at different sections. Region of highest evaporation rate would have rapidly reduced area and would become break up cross-section. Resistance of the wire as whole increases with time. Overall resistance increases hence power decreases. P V R = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec 2 or P R V \u221d \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 as is constant . At break up junction temperature would be highest, thus light of highest band frequency would be emitted at those cross-section. 25. (a,c) By reciprocity theorem of mutual induction, it can be assumed that current in infinite wire is varying at 10A/s and EMF is induced in triangular loop. Flux of magnetic field through triangle loop, if current in infinite wire is \u03c6, can be calculated as follows: d i y ydy \u03c6 \u00b5 \u03c0 = \u22c5 0 2 2 \u21d2 d i dy \u03c6 \u00b5 \u03c0 = 0 \u21d2 \u03c6 \u00b5 \u03c0 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 0 2 i l \u21d2EMF = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u22c5 d dt l di dt \u03c6 \u00b5 \u03c0 0 2 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= \u00b5 \u03c0 \u00b5 \u03c0 0 0 10 10 ( ) cm volt A s If we assume the current in the wire towards right then as the flux in the loop increases we know that the induced current in the wire is counter clockwise. Hence, the current in the wire is towards right. Field due to triangular loop at the location of infinite wire is into the paper. Hence, force on infinite wire is away from the loop. By cylindrical symmetry about infinite wire, rotation of triangular loop  will not cause any additional EMF. 26. (a,c) For maximum range of voltage resistance should be maximum. So, all four should be connected in series. For maximum range of current, net resistance should be least. Therefore, all four should be connected in parallel. y 2y dy i  27.
