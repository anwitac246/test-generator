Chapter 1 Basic Mathematics \u0097 3  Graphs Following graphs and their corresponding equations are frequently used in Physics. (i) y mx = , represents a straight line passing through origin. Here, m = tan \u03b8 is also called the slope of line, where \u03b8 is the angle which the line makes with positive x-axis, when drawn in anticlockwise direction from the positive x-axis towards the line. The two possible cases are shown in Fig. 1.1. In Fig. 1.1 (i), \u03b8 < \u00b0 90 .Therefore, tan \u03b8 or slope of line is positive. In Fig. 1.1 (ii), 90 180 \u00b0 < < \u00b0 \u03b8 .Therefore, tan \u03b8 or slope of line is negative. Note That y mx = or y x \u221d also means that value of y becomes 2 times if x is doubled. Or it will remain 1 4 th if x becomes 1 4 times. (ii) y mx c = + , represents a straight line not passing through origin. Here, m is the slope of line as discussed above and c the intercept on y-axis. In figure (i) : slope and intercept both are positive. In figure (ii) : slope is negative but intercept is positive and In figure (iii) : slope is positive but intercept is negative. Note That in y mx c = + , y does not become two times if x is doubled. (iii) y x \u221d1 or y x = 2 etc., represents a rectangular hyperbola in first and third quadrants. The shape of rectangular hyperbola is shown in Fig. 1.3(i). 4 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u03b8 x y (i) (ii) c = +ve \u03b8 x y c = +ve \u03b8 x y c = \u2013ve (iii) Fig. 1.2 \u03b8 x y \u03b8 x y (i) (ii) Fig. 1.1 x y (i) x y (ii) Fig. 1.3  From the graph we can see that y\u21920 as x \u2192\u221eor x \u21920 as y\u2192\u221e. Similarly, y x = \u22124 represents a rectangular hyperbola in second and fourth quadrants as shown in Fig. 1.3(ii). Note That in case of rectangular hyperbola if x is doubled y will become half. (iv) y x \u221d 2 or y x = 2 2, etc., represents a parabola passing through origin as shown in Fig. 1.4(i). Note That in the parabola y x = 2 2 or y x \u221d 2, if x is doubled, y will become four times. Graph x y \u221d 2 or x y = 4 2 is again a parabola passing through origin as shown in Fig 1.4 (ii). In this case if y is doubled, x will become four times. (v) y x = + 2 4 or x y = \u2212 2 6 will represent a parabola but not passing through origin. In the first equation ( ), y x = + 2 4 if x is doubled, y will not become four times. (vi) y Ae Kx = \u2212 ; represents exponentially decreasing graph. Value of y decreases exponentially from A to 0. The graph is shown in Fig. 1.5. From the graph and the equation, we can see that y A = at x = 0 and y\u21920 as x \u2192\u221e. (vii) y A e Kx = \u2212 \u2212 ( ), 1 represents an exponentially increasing graph. Value of y increases exponentially from 0 to A. The graph is shown in Fig. 1.6. From the graph and the equation we can see that y = 0 at x = 0 and y A \u2192 as x \u2192\u221e. Chapter 1 Basic Mathematics \u0097 5 A y x Fig. 1.5 x y (i) y x \u221d 2 x y (ii) x y \u221d 2 Fig. 1.4 A y x Fig. 1.6  Maxima and Minima Suppose y is a function of x. Or y f x = ( ). Then we can draw a graph between x and y. Let the graph is as shown in Fig. 1.7. Then from the graph we can see that at maximum or minimum value of y slope or dy dx \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7to the graph is zero. Thus, dy dx = 0 at maximum or minimum value of y. By putting dy dx = 0we will get different values of x. At these values of x, value of y is maximum if d y dx 2 2 (double differentiation of y with respect to x) is negative at this value of x. Similarly y is minimum if d y dx 2 2 is positive.

V Example 2.1 Let us use a centimeter scale (on which only centimeter scales are there) to measure a length AB. From the figure, we can see that length AB is more than 7 cm and less than 8 cm. In this case, Least Count (LC) of this centimeter scale is 1 cm, as it can measure accurately upto centimeters only. If we note down the length ( )l of line AB as l cm = 7 then maximum uncertainty or maximum possible error in l can be 1 cm ( ) = LC , because this scale can measure accurately only upto 1 cm. V Example 2.2 Let us now use a millimeter scale (on which millimeter marks are there). This is also our normal meter scale which we use in our routine life. From the figure, we can see that length AB is more than 3.3 cm and less than 3.4cm. If we note down the length, l ",

        "content": "cm = = 3.4 Then, this measurement has two significant figures 3 and 4 in which 3 is absolutely correct and 4 is reasonably correct (doubtful). Least count of this scale is 0.1 cm because this scale can measure accurately only upto 0.1 cm. Further, maximum uncertainty or maximum possible error in l can also be 0.1 cm. 1. If we measure a length l = 6.24 cm with the help of a vernier callipers, then (a) What is least count of vernier callipers ? (b) How many significant figures are there in the measured length ? (c) Which digits are absolutely correct and which is/are doubtful ? 2. If we measure a length l = 3.267 cm with the help of a screw gauge, then (a) What is maximum uncertainty or maximum possible error inl ? (b) How many significant figures are there in the measured length ? (c) Which digits are absolutely correct and which is/are doubtful ? 2.2 Significant Figures From example 2.2, we can conclude that: \"In a measured quantity, significant figures are the digits which are absolutely correct plus the first uncertain digit\". 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 A B 0 Fig. 2.1 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 2.1 A B 1 2 3 4 Fig. 2.2  Rules for Counting Significant Figures Rule 1 All non-zero digits are significant. For example, 126.28 has five significant figures. Rule 2 The zeros appearing between two non-zero digits are significant. For example, 6.025 has four significant figures. Rule 3 Trailing zeros after decimal places are significant. Measurement l = 6.400 cm has four significant figures. Let us take an example in its support. Table 2.1 Measurement Accuracy l lies between (in cm) Significant figures Remarks l = 6.4 cm 0.1 cm 6.3 6.5 \u2212 Two l = 6.40 cm 0.01 cm 6.39 6.41 \u2212 Three closer l = 6.400 cm 0.001 cm 6.399 6.401 \u2212 Four more closer Thus, the significant figures depend on the accuracy of measurement. More the number of significant figures, more accurate is the measurement. Rule 4 The powers of ten are not counted as significant figures. For example,1.4 \u00d7 \u2212 10 7 has only two significant figures 1 and 4. Rule 5 If a measurement is less than one, then all zeros occurring to the left of last non-zero digit are not significant. For example, 0.0042 has two significant figures 4 and 2. Rule 6 Change in units of measurement of a quantity does not change the number of significant figures. Suppose a measurement was done using mm scale and we get l = 72 mm (two significant figures). We can write this measurement in other units also (without changing the number of significant figures) : ` 7.2 cm \u2192 Two significant figures. 0.072 m \u2192 Two significant figures. 0.000072 km \u2192 Two significant figures. 7.2 nm \u00d7107 \u2192 Two significant figures Rule 7 The terminal or trailing zeros in a number without a decimal point are not significant. This also sometimes arises due to change of unit. For example, 264 m = 26400 cm = 264000 mm All have only three significant figures 2, 6 and 4. All trailing zeros are not significant. Zeroes at the end of a number are significant only if they are behind a decimal point as in Rule-3. Otherwise, it is impossible to tell if they are significant. For example, in the number 8200, it is not clear if the zeros are significant or not. The number of significant digits in 8200 is at least two, but could be three or four. To avoid uncertainty, use scientific notation to place significant zeros behind a decimal point 8.200 \u00d7103 has four significant digits. Chapter 2 Measurement and Errors \u0097 15  8.20 \u00d7103 has three significant digits. 8.2 \u00d7103 has two significant digits. Therefore, if it is not expressed in scientific notations, then write least number of significant digits. Hence, in the number 8200, take significant digits as two. Rule 8 Exact measurements have infinite number of significant figures. For example, 10 bananas in a basket 46 students in a class speed of light in vacuum = 299 792 458 , , ( ) m/s exact \u03c0 = 22 7 (exact) All these measurements have infinite number of significant figures.

Count total number of significant figures in the following measurements: (a) 4.080 cm (b) 0.079 m (c) 950 (d) 10.00 cm (e) 4.07080 (f) 7.090 \u00d7 105 2.3 Rounding Off a Digit Following are the rules for rounding off a measurement : Rule 1 If the number lying to the right of cut off digit is less than 5, then the cut off digit is retained as such. However, if it is more than 5, then the cut off digit is increased by 1. For example, x = 6.24is rounded off to6.2to two significant digits and x = 5.328is rounded off to5.33 to three significant digits. Rule 2 If the digit to be dropped is 5 followed by digits other than zero, then the preceding digit is increased by 1. For example, x =14.252 is rounded off to x =14.3 to three significant digits. Rule 3 If the digit to be dropped is simply 5 or 5 followed by zeros, then the preceding digit it left unchanged if it is even. For example, x = 6.250 or x = 6.25 becomes x = 6.2 after rounding off to two significant digits. 16 \u0097 Mechanics - I INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 2.2  Rule 4 If the digit to be dropped is 5 or 5 followed by zeros, then the preceding digit is raised by one if it is odd. For example, x = 6.350 or x = 6.35 becomes x = 6.4 after rounding off to two significant digits. V Example 2.4 Table 2.3 Measured value After rounding off to three significant digits Rule 7.364 7.36 1 7.367 7.37 1 8.3251 8.33 2 9.445 9.44 3 9.4450 9.44 3 15.75 15.8 4 15.7500 15.8 4 1.

Round 742396 to four, three and two significant digits. 2.4 Algebraic Operations with Significant Figures The final result shall have significant figures corresponding to their number in the least accurate variable involved. To understand this, let us consider a chain of which all links are strong except the one. The chain will obviously break at the weakest link. Thus, the strength of the chain cannot be more than the strength of the weakest link in the chain. Addition and Subtraction Suppose, in the measured values to be added or subtracted the least number of digits after the decimal is n. Then, in the sum or difference also, the number of digits after the decimal should be n. V Example 2.5 1.2 3.45 6.789 11.439 11.4 + + = \u2248 Here, the least number of significant digits after the decimal is one. Hence, the result will be 11.4 (when rounded off to smallest number of decimal places). V Example 2.6 12.63 10.2 2.43 2.4 \u2212 = \u2248 Multiplication or Division Suppose in the measured values to be multiplied or divided the least number of significant digits be n. Then in the product or quotient, the number of significant digits should also be n. V Example 2.7 1.2 36.72 44.064 \u00d7 = \u224844 The least number of significant digits in the measured values are two. Hence, the result when rounded off to two significant digits become 44. Therefore, the answer is 44.

Every instrument can measure upto a certain accuracy called Least Count (LC). Least Count The smallest measurement that can be measured accurately by an instrument is called its least count. Instrument Its least count mm scale 1 mm Vernier callipers 0.1 mm Screw gauge 0.01 mm Stop watch 0.1 sec Temperature thermometer 1\u00b0C Permissible Error due to Least Count Error in measurement due to the limitation (or least count) of the instrument is called permissible error. Least count of a millimeter scale is 1 mm. Therefore, maximum permissible error in the measurement of a length by a millimeter scale may be 1 mm. If we measure a length l = 26 mm. Then, maximum value of true value may be ( ) 26 1 27 + = mm mm and minimum value of true value may be ( ) 26 1 25 \u2212 = mm mm. Thus, we can write it like, l = \u00b1 ( ) 26 1 mm If from any other instrument we measure a length = 24.6 mm, then the maximum permissible error (or least count) from this instrument is 0.1 mm. So, we can write the measurement like, l = \u00b1 ( ) 24.6 0.1 mm Classification of Errors Errors can be classified in two ways. First classification is based on the cause of error. Systematic error and random errors fall in this group. Second classification is based on the magnitude of errors. Absolute error, mean absolute error and relative (or fractional) error lie on this group. Now, let us discuss them separately. Systematic Error Systematic errors are the errors whose causes are known to us. Such errors can therefore be minimised. Following are few causes of these errors : (a) Instrumental errors may be due to erroneous instruments. These errors can be reduced by using more accurate instruments and applying zero correction, when required. (b) Sometimes errors arise on account of ignoring certain facts. For example in measuring time period of simple pendulum error may creep because no consideration is taken of air resistance. These errors can be reduced by applying proper corrections to the formula used. (c) Change in temperature, pressure, humidity, etc., may also sometimes cause errors in the result. Relevant corrections can be made to minimise their effects. Chapter 2 Measurement and Errors \u0097 19  Random Error The causes of random errors are not known. Hence, it is not possible to remove them completely. These errors may arise due to a variety of reasons. For example the reading of a sensitive beam balance may change by the vibrations caused in the building due to persons moving in the laboratory or vehicles running nearby. The random errors can be minimized by repeating the observation a large number of times and taking the arithmetic mean of all the observations. The mean value would be very close to the most accurate reading. Thus, a a a a n n mean = + +\u2026 + 1 2 Absolute Error The difference between the true value and the measured value of a quantity is called an absolute error. Usually the mean value am is taken as the true value. So, if a a a a n m n = + +\u2026+ 1 2 Then by definition, absolute errors in the measured values of the quantity are, \u2206a a a m 1 1 = \u2212 \u2206a a a m 2 2 = \u2212 \u2026 \u2026 \u2026 \u2206a a a n m n = \u2212 Absolute error may be positive or negative. Mean Absolute Error Arithmetic mean of the magnitudes of absolute errors in all the measurements is called the mean absolute error. Thus, \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 a a a a n n mean = + +\u2026 + | | | | | | 1 2 The final result of measurement can be written as, a a a m mean = \u00b1 \u2206 This implies that value of a is likely to lie between a a m mean + \u2206 and a a m mean \u2212\u2206 . Relative or Fractional Error The ratio of mean absolute error to the mean value of the quantity measured is called relative or fractional error. Thus, Relative error = mean \u2206a am Relative error expressed in percentage is called as the percentage error, i.e. Percentage error = \u00d7 \u2206a am mean 100 20 \u0097 Mechanics - I  V Example 2.11 The diameter of a wire as measured by screw gauge was found to be 2.620, 2.625, 2.630, 2.628 and 2.626 cm. Calculate (a) mean value of diameter (b) absolute error in each measurement (c) mean absolute error (d) fractional error (e) percentage error (f) Express the result in terms of percentage error Solution (a) Mean value of diameter am = 2.620 + 2.625 + 2.630 + 2.628 + 2.626 5 = 2.6258cm = 2.626cm (rounding off to three decimal places) (b) Taking am as the true value, the absolute errors in different observations are, \u2206a1 = 2.626 \u2013 2.620 = + 0.006cm \u2206a2 = 2.626 \u2013 2.625 = + 0.001cm \u2206a3 = 2.626 \u2013 2.630 = \u2013 0.004 cm \u2206a4 = 2.626 \u2013 2.628 = \u2013 0.002cm \u2206a5 = 2.626 \u2013 2.626 = 0.000cm (c) Mean absolute error, \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 a a a a a a mean = + + + + | | | | | | | | | | 1 2 3 4 5 5 = 0.006 + 0.001+ 0.004 + 0.002 + 0.000 5 = 0.0026= 0.003 (rounding off to three decimal places) (d) Fractional error = \u00b1 \u2206a am mean = \u00b1 0.003 2.626 = \u00b1 0.001 (e) Percentage error = \u00b1 \u00d7 = \u00b1 0.001 100 0.1% (f) Diameter of wire can be written as, d = \u00b1 2.626 0.1% Combination of Errors Errors in Sum or Difference Let x a b = \u00b1 Further, let \u2206a is the absolute error in the measurement of a, \u2206bthe absolute error in the measurement of b and \u2206x is the absolute error in the measurement of x.

The device generally used in everyday life for measurement of length is a meter scale (we can also call it mm scale). It can be used for measurement of length with an accuracy of 1 mm. So, the least count of a meter scale is 1 mm. To measure length accurately upto 0.1 mm or 0.01 mm vernier callipers and screw gauge are used. Vernier callipers has following three parts : (i) Main scale It consists of a steel metallic strip M, graduated in cm and mm at one edge. It carries two fixed jaws A and C as shown in figure. (ii) Vernier scale Vernier scale V slides on metallic strip M. It can be fixed in any position by screw S. The side of the vernier scale which slide over the mm sides has ten divisions over a length of 9 mm. B and D two movable jaws are fixed with it. When vernier scale is pushed towards A and C, then B touches A and straight side of C will touch straight side of D. In this position, if the instrument is free from error, zeros of vernier scale will coincide with zeros of main scales. To measure the external diameter of an object it is held between the jaws A and B, while the straight edges of C and D are used for measuring the internal diameter of a hollow object. (iii) Metallic strip There is a thin metallic strip E attached to the back side of M and connected with vernier scale. When jaws A and B touch each other, the edge of E touches the edge of M. When the jaws A and B are separated E moves outwards. This strip E is used for measuring the depth of a vessel. Principle (Theory) In the common form, the divisions on the vernier scale V are smaller in size than the smallest division on the main scale M, but in some special cases the size of the vernier division may be larger than the main scale division. Let n vernier scale divisions (VSD) coincide with ( ) n \u22121 main scale divisions (MSD). Then, n n ",

The main scale of a vernier callipers reads 10 mm in 10 divisions. Ten divisions of vernier scale coincide with nine divisions of the main scale. When the two jaws of the callipers touch each other, the fifth division of the vernier coincides with 9 main scale divisions and the zero of the vernier is to the right of zero of main scale, when a cylinder is tightly placed between the two jaws, the zero of the vernier scale lies slightly to the left of 3.2 cm and the fourth vernier division coincides with a main scale division. Find diameter of the cylinder. 2. In a vernier callipers, N divisions of the main scale coincide with N m + divisions of the vernier scale. What is the value of m for which the instrument has minimum least count. 3.2 Screw Gauge Principle of a Micrometer Screw The least count of vernier callipers ordinarily available in the laboratory is 0.01 cm. When lengths are to be measured with greater accuracy, say upto 0.001 cm, screw gauge and spherometer are used which are based on the principle of micrometer screw discussed below. If an accurately cut single threaded screw is rotated in a closely fitted nut, then in addition to the circular motion of the screw there is a linear motion of the screw head in the forward or backward direction, along the axis of the screw. The linear distance moved by the screw, when it is given one complete rotation is called the pitch (p) of the screw. This is equal to the distance between two consecutive threads as measured along the axis of the screw. In most of the cases, it is either 1 mm or 0.5 mm. A circular cap is fixed on one end of the screw and the circumference of the cap is normally divided into 100 or 50 equal parts. If it is divided into 100 equal parts, then the screw moves forward or backward by 1 100 or 1 50 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7of the pitch, if the circular scale (we will discuss later about circular scale) is rotated through one circular scale division. It is the minimum distance which can be accurately measured and so called the Least Count (LC) of the screw. Thus, Least count Pitch Number of divisions on circular = scale 38 \u0097 Mechanics - I p 0 95 Fig. 3.5 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 3.1  If pitch is 1 mm and there are 100 divisions on circular scale then, LC = 1mm 100 = 0.01mm = 0.001cm = 10 m \u00b5 Since, LC is of the order of 10 \u00b5m, the screw is called micrometer screw. Screw Gauge Screw gauge works on the principle of micrometer screw. It consists of a U-shaped metal frame M. At one end of it is fixed a small metal piece A. It is called stud and it has a plane face. The other end N of M carries a cylindrical hub H. It is graduated in millimeter and half millimeter depending upon the pitch of the screw. This scale is called linear scale or pitch scale. A nut is threaded through the hub and the frame N. Through the nut moves a screw S. The front face B of the screw, facing the plane face A is also plane. A hollow cylindrical cap K is capable of rotating over the hub when screw is rotated. As the cap is rotated the screw either moves in or out. The surface E of the cap K is divided into 50 or 100 equal parts. It is called the circular scale or head scale. In an accurately adjusted instrument when the faces A and B are just touching each other. Zero of circular scale should coincide with zero of linear scale. To Measure Diameter of a Given Wire Using a Screw Gauge If with the wire between plane faces A and B, the edge of the cap lies ahead of N th division of linear scale, and nth division of circular scale lies over reference line.

If the zero of the circular scale advances beyond the reference line the zero error is negative and zero correction is positive. If it is left behind the reference line the zero is positive and zero correction is negative. For example, if zero of circular scale advances beyond the reference line by 5 divisions, zero correction = + \u00d7 5 (LC) and if the zero of circular scale is left behind the reference line by 5 divisions, zero correction = \u2212 \u00d7 5 (LC). Note In negative zero error 95th division of the circular scale is coinciding with the reference line. Hence there are 5 divisions between zero mark on the circular scale and the reference line. Back Lash Error When the sense of rotation of the screw is suddenly changed, the screw head may rotate, but the screw itself may not move forward or backwards. Thus, the scale reading may change even by the actual movement of the screw. This is known as back lash error. This error is due to loose fitting of the screw. This arises due to wear and tear of the threading due to prolonged use of the screw. To reduce this error the screw must always be rotated in the same direction for a particular set of observations. V Example 3.4 The pitch of a screw gauge is 1 mm and there are 100 divisions on the circular scale. In measuring the diameter of a sphere there are six divisions on the linear scale and forty divisions on circular scale coincide with the reference line. Find the diameter of the sphere.

When faces A and B are just touching each without putting anything between the studs 32nd division of the circular scale (below its zero) coincides with the reference line. When a glass plate is placed between the studs, the linear scale reads 4 divisions and the circular scale reads 16 divisions. Find the thickness of the glass plate.

Read the screw gauge shown below in the figure. Given that circular scale has 100 divisions and in one complete rotation the screw advances by  1mm. 2. The pitch of a screw gauge having 50 divisions on its circular scale is 1 mm. When the two jaws of the screw gauge are in contact with each other, the zero of the circular scale lies 6 divisions below the line of graduation. When a wire is placed between the jaws , 3 linear scale divisions are clearly visible while 31st division on the circular scale coincides with the reference line. Find diameter of the wire. 3.3 Determination of \u2018g \u2019 using a Simple Pendulum In this experiment, a small spherical bob is hanged with a cotton thread. This arrangement is called simple pendulum. The bob is displaced slightly and allowed to oscillate. The period of small oscillations is given by T L g = 2\u03c0 where, L l r = + (as shown in figure) = equivalent length of pendulum \u2234 g L T = 4 2 2 \u03c0 ...(i) To find time period, time taken for 50 oscillations is noted using a stop watch. \u2234 T = Time taken for 50 oscillations 50 Now, substituting the values of T and L in Eq.

A mass M is hanged from a wire of length L, cross sectional radius r and Young's modulus Y . Let change in length in wire is l. Then, Stress = = F A Mg r \u03c0 2 Strain = l L and Young's modulus Y = Stress Strain or Y Mg r l L = / / \u03c0 2 \u21d2 l L r Y Mg = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c0 2 or l L r Y w = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c0 2 \u21d2 l w \u221d Therefore, l versus w graph is a straight line passing through origin with Slope = = L r Y \u03c0 \u03b8 2 tan \u2234 Y L r = \u03c0 \u03b8 2 (tan ) ...(i) Thus, by measuring the slope (or tan \u03b8) we can find Young's modulus Y from Eq. (i). Note We can also take load along y-axis and elongation along x-axis. In that case, slope = \u03c0r Y L 2 44 \u0097 Mechanics - I M L M l Load = = w Mg Fig. 3.13 Elongation ( )l Load ( = ) w mg O \u03b8 Slope = tan \u03b8 = L r Y \u03c0 2 Fig. 3.14  Limitations of this Method 1. For small loads, there may be some bends or kinks in the wire. So, it is better to start with some initial weight, so that wire becomes straight. 2. There is slight difference in behaviour of wire under loading and unloading load. Modification in Searle's Method To keep the experimental wire straight and kink free we start with some dead load (say 2 kg). Now, we gradually increase the load and measure the extra elongation. l L r Y w = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c0 2 \u21d2 \u2206 \u2206 l L r Y w = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c0 2 \u21d2 \u2206 \u2206 l w \u221d or \u2206l versus \u2206w graph is again a straight line passing through origin with same slope, L r Y \u03c0 2 Chapter 3 Experiments \u0097 45 Elongation Load Unloading Loading Elongation Load Unloading Loading Ideal situation Real situation Fig. 3.16 M Fig. 3.15 \u2206l \u2206w \u03b8 Slope = tan \u03b8 L r Y \u03c0 2 = Fig. 3.17  To measure extra elongation, compared to initial loaded position, we use a reference wire also carrying 2 kg. Searle's Apparatus It consists of two metal frames P and Q hinged together, such that they can have only vertical relative motion. A spirit level (S.L.) is supported at one end on a rigid cross bar frame whose other end rests on the tip of a micrometer screw C. If there is any relative motion between the two frames, the spirit level no longer remains horizontal and the bubble is displaced in the spirit level. To bring the bubble back to its original position, the screw has to be moved up or down. The distance through which the screw has to be moved gives the relative motion between the two frames. The frames are suspended by two identical long wires of the same material, from the same rigid horizontal support. Wire B is the experimental wire and the wire A acts simply as a reference wire. The frames are provided with hooks H1 and H2 at their ends from which weights are suspended. The hook H1 attached to the frame of the reference wire carries a constant weight W to keep the wire taut. To the hook H2 of the experimental wire (i.e. wire B), is attached a hanger over which slotted weights can be placed to apply the stretching force, Mg. Method Step 1 Measure the length of the experimental wire. Step 2 Measure the diameter of the experimental wire with the help of a screw gauge at about five different places. Step 3 Find pitch and least count of the micrometer and adjust it such that the bubble in spirit level is exactly at the centre. Also note down the initial reading of micrometer. 46 \u0097 Mechanics - I 2 kg 2 kg Reference wire Experiment wire Fig. 3.18 w ",

(a) Average elongation of wire will be determined with a particular load while increasing the load and decreasing the load. (b) Reference wire will be just taut and experimental wire will undergo for elongation. (c) Air bubble in the spirit level will be disturbed from the central position due to relative displacement between the wires due to elongation. (d) Average elongation of the wires is to be determined by increasing the load attached to both the wires. 3.5 Determination of Specific Heat Determination of Specific Heat Capacity of a given Solid Specific heat of a solid can be determined by the \"Method of Mixture\" using the concept of the \"Law of Heat Exchange\" i.e. Heat lost by hot body = Heat gained by cold body The method of mixture is based on the fact that when a hot solid body is mixed with a cold body, the hot body loses heat and the cold body absorbs heat until thermal equilibrium is attained. At equilibrium, final temperature of mixture is measured. The specific heat of the solid is calculated with the help of the law of heat exchange.

Determination of Specific Heat Capacity of the given Liquid by the Method of Mixtures To determine the specific heat capacity of a liquid by the method of mixtures a solid of known specific heat capacity is taken and the given liquid is taken in the calorimeter in place of water. Suppose a solid of mass ms and specific heat capacity cs is heated to T2 oC and then mixed with m1 mass of liquid of specific heat capacity c1 at temperature T1. The temperature of the mixture is T. Then, Heat lost by the solid = \u2212 m c T T s s ( ) 2 Heat gained by the liquid plus calorimeter = + \u2212 ( ) ( ) m c m c T T c c 1 1 1 By law of heat exchange, Heat lost = Heat gained \u2234 m c T T m c m c T T s s c c ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 1 1 1 \u2212 = + \u2212 From this equation, we calculate the value of c1. However, the procedure remains exactly the same as done previously. Note Specific heat is also called specific heat capacity and may be denoted by S, similarly temperature by \u03b8. V Example 3.11 The mass, specific heat capacity and the temperature of a solid are 1000 g, 1 2 cal g C / -\u00b0 and 80\u00b0C respectively. The mass of the liquid and the calorimeter are 900 g and 200 g. Initially, both are at room temperature 20\u00b0C. Both calorimeter and the solid are made of same material.

Electrical Calorimeter Figure shows an electrical calorimeter to determine specific heat capacity of an unknown liquid. We take a known quantity of liquid in an insulated calorimeter and heat it by passing a known current (i) through a heating coil immersed within the liquid. First of all, mass of empty calorimeter is measured and suppose it is m1. Then, the unknown liquid is poured in it. Now, the combined mass (of calorimeter and liquid) is measured and let it be m2. So, the mass of unknown liquid is ( ) m m 2 1 \u2212 . Initially, both are at room temperature ( ) \u03b8 0 . Now, current i is passed through the heating coil at a potential difference V for time t. Due to this heat, the temperature of calorimeter and unknown liquid increase simultaneously. Suppose the final temperature is\u03b8 f . If there is no heat loss to the surroundings, then Heat supplied by the heating coil = heat absorbed by the liquid + heat absorbed by the calorimeter. \u2234 Vit m m S m S l f c f = \u2212 \u2212 + \u2212 ( ) ( ) ( ) 2 1 0 1 0 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 Here S l = Specific heat of unknown liquid and S c = Specific heat of calorimeter Solving this equation we get, S m m Vit m S l f c = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u2212 \u2212 \uf8ee \uf8f0 \uf8ef \uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb \uf8fa \uf8fa 1 2 1 0 1 \u03b8 \u03b8 Note The sources of error in this experiment are errors due to improper connection of the heating coil and the radiation losses.

(According to the rules of significant figures) 3.6 Speed of Sound using Resonance Tube Apparatus Figure shows a resonance tube. It consists of a long vertical glass tubeT. A metre scale S (graduated in mm) is fixed adjacent to this tube. The zero of the scale coincides with the upper end of the tube. The lower end of the tubeT is connected to a reservoir R of water tube through a pipe P. The water level in the tube can be adjusted by the adjustable screws attached with the reservoir. The vertical adjustment of the tube can be made with the help of levelling screws. For fine adjustments of the water level in the tube, the pinchcock is used. Principle If a vibrating tuning fork (of known frequency) is held over the open end of the resonance tube T, then resonance is obtained at some position as the level of water is lowered. If e is the end correction of the tube and l1 is the length from the water level to the top of the tube, then l e 1 4 + = \u03bb = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 4 v f \u2026(i) 52 \u0097 Mechanics - I 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 A T S B R Reservoir Rubber tubing Pinch cock Levelling screw P Fig. 3.24  Here, v is the speed of sound in air and f is the frequency of tuning fork (or air column).

In the experiment for the determination of the speed of sound in air using the resonance column method, the length of the air column that resonates in the fundamental mode, with a tuning fork is 0.1 m.

Procedure By shifting the rheostat contact, readings of ammeter and voltmeter are noted down. At least six set of observations are taken. Then, a graph is plotted between potential differenceV and current I. The graph comes to be a straight line as shown in figure. Result It is found from the graph that the ratio V I is constant. Hence, current voltage relationship is established, i.e.V I \u221d.It means Ohm\u2019s law is established. Precautions 1. The connections should be clean and tight. 2. Rheostat should be of low resistance. 3. Thick copper wire should be used for connections. 4. The key should be inserted only while taking observations to avoid heating of resistance. 5. The effect of finite resistance of the voltmeter can be over come by using a high resistance instrument or a potentiometer. 6. The lengths of connecting wires should be minimised as much as possible.

First of all, we make a rough estimation of f . For this, make a sharp image of a far away object (like sun) on a filter paper. The image distance of the far object will be an approximate estimation of focal length f . Now, the object needle is kept beyond F, so that its real and inverted image I can be formed. You can see this inverted image in the mirror by closing your one eye and keeping the other eye along the pole of the mirror. To locate the position of the image use a second needle and shift this needle such that its peak coincide with the image. The second needle gives the distance of image v. This image is called image needle I. Note the object distance u and image distance v from the mm scale on optical bench. Take some more observations in similar manner. 64 \u0097 Mechanics - I Image needle Object needle u v I\u2032 M P I Image O Fig. 3.36 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 3.8 ",

Finally taking average of all we can find the focal length. Method 2 The relation between object distance u and the image v from the pole of the mirror is given by 1 1 1 v u f + = \u22c5 where, f is the focal length of the mirror. The focal length of the concave mirror can be obtained from 1 v versus 1 u graph. When the image is real (of course only upon then it can be obtained on screen), the object lies between focus ( ) F and infinity. In such a situation, u, v and f all are negative.

Index Error In u v - method, we require the distance between object or image from the pole P of the mirror. This is called actual distance.

The measurement of the quantity is mentioned in two parts, the first part gives how many times of the standard unit and the second part gives the name of the unit. Thus, suppose I say that length of this wire is 5 metre. The numeric part 5 says that it is 5 times of the unit of length and the second part metre says that unit chosen here is metre. 4.2 Fundamental and Derived Units There are a large number of physical quantities and every quantity needs a unit. However, not all the quantities are independent. For example, if a unit of length is defined, a unit of volume is automatically obtained. Thus, we can define a set of fundamental quantities and all other quantities may be expressed in terms of the fundamental quantities. Fundamental quantities are only seven in numbers. Unit of all other quantities can be expressed in terms of the units of these seven quantities by multiplication or division. Many different choices can be made for the fundamental quantities. For example, if we take length and time as the fundamental quantities then speed is a derived quantity and if we take speed and time as fundamental quantities then length is a derived quantity. Several system of units are in use over the world. The units defined for the fundamental quantities are called fundamental units and those obtained for derived quantities are called the derived units. SI Units In 1971, General Conference on Weight and Measures held its meeting and decided a system of units which is known as the International System of Units. It is abbreviated as SI from the French name Le System International d\u2019 Unites. This system is widely used throughout the world. Table below gives the seven fundamental quantities and their SI units. Table 4.1 Fundamental quantities and their SI units. S.No. Quantity SI Unit Symbol 1. Length metre m 2. Mass kilogram kg 3. Time second s 4. Electric current ampere A 5. Thermodynamic temperature kelvin K 6. Amount of substance mole mol 7. Luminous intensity candela cd Two supplementary units namely plane angle and solid angle are also defined. Their units are radian (rad) and steradian (st) respectively. (i) CGS System In this system, the units of length, mass and time are centimetre (cm), gram (g) and second (s) respectively. The unit of force is dyne and that of work or energy is erg. (ii) FPS System In this system, the units of length, mass and time are foot, pound and second. The unit of force in this system is poundal.  Definitions of Some Important SI Units (i) Metre : 1m = 1,650,763.73 wavelengths in vacuum, of radiation corresponding to orange-red light of krypton-86. (ii) Second : 1 9192 631 770 s = , , , time periods of a particular radiation from Cesium-133 atom. (iii) Kilogram : 1 kg = mass of 1 litre volume of water at 4\u00b0C. (iv) Ampere : It is the current which when flows through two infinitely long straight conductors of negligible cross-section placed at a distance of one metre in vacuum produces a force of 2 10 7 \u00d7 \u2212N/m between them. (v) Kelvin : 1K = 1 273.16 / part of the thermodynamic temperature of triple point of water. (vi) Mole : It is the amount of substance of a system which contains as many elementary particles (atoms, molecules, ions etc.) as there are atoms in 12 g of carbon-12. (vii) Candela : It is luminous intensity in a perpendicular direction of a surface of 1 600000 2 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7m of a black body at the temperature of freezing platinum under a pressure of1.013 105 \u00d7 N/m 2. (viii) Radian : It is the plane angle between two radii of a circle which cut-off on the circumference, an arc equal in length to the radius. (ix) Steradian : The steradian is the solid angle which having its vertex at the centre of the sphere, cut-off an area of the surface of sphere equal to that of a square with sides of length equal to the radius of the sphere. 4.3 Dimensions Dimensions of a physical quantity are the powers to which the fundamental quantities must be raised to represent the given physical quantity. For example, density = mass volume = mass (length)3 or density = (mass) (length)\u20133 \u2026(i) Thus, the dimensions of density are 1 in mass and \u22123 in length. The dimensions of all other fundamental quantities are zero.For convenience, the fundamental quantities are represented by one letter symbols. Generally mass is denoted by M, length by L, time by T and electric current by A. The thermodynamic temperature, the amount of substance and the luminous intensity are denoted by the symbols of their units K, mol and cd respectively. The physical quantity that is expressed in terms of the base quantities is enclosed in square brackets. Thus, Eq. (i) can be written as [density] = [ML ] \u20133 Chapter 4 Units and Dimensions \u0097 81 SI Prefixes The most commonly used prefixes are given below in tabular form. Power of 10 Prefix Symbol 6 mega M 3 kilo k \u22122 centi c \u22123 milli m \u22126 micro \u00b5 \u22129 nano n  Such an expression for a physical quantity in terms of the fundamental quantities is called the dimensional formula. Here, it is worthnoting that constants such as 5, \u03c0 or trigonometrical functions such as sin \u03b8, cos \u03b8, etc., have no units and dimensions.

To check the dimensional correctness of a given physical equation Every physical equation should be dimensionally balanced. This is called the \u2018Principle of Homogeneity\u2019. The dimensions of each term on both sides of an equation must be the same. On this basis, we can judge whether a given equation is correct or not. But a dimensionally correct equation may or may not be physically correct. V Example 4.4 Show that the expression of the time period T of a simple pendulum of length l given by T l g = 2\u03c0 is dimensionally correct.

        "content": "[T = = \u22122 As in the above equation, the dimensions of both sides are same. The given formula is dimensionally correct. Principle of Homogeneity of Dimensions This principle states that the dimensions of all the terms in a physical expression should be same. For example, in the physical expression s ut at = + 1 2 2, the dimensions of s ut , and 1 2 2 at all are same. Note The physical quantities separated by the symbols + \u2212= > < , , , , etc., have the same dimensions. V Example 4.5 The velocity v of a particle depends upon the time t according to the equation v a bt c d t = + + + \u22c5Write the dimensions of a b c , , and d. Solution From principle of homogeneity, [ ] [ ] a v = or [ ] a = [LT ] \u20131 [ ] [ ] bt v = or [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] b v t = = [LT ] T \u20131 or [ ] b = [LT ] \u20132 Similarly, [ ] [ ] [ ] d t = = T Further, [ ] [ ] [ ] c d t v + = or [ ] [ ][ ] c v d t = + or [ ]c = [LT ][T] \u20131 or [ ]c = [L] 3. To establish the relation among various physical quantities If we know the factors on which a given physical quantity may depend, we can find a formula relating the quantity with those factors. Let us take an example. V Example 4.6 The frequency ( ) f of a stretched string depends upon the tension F (dimensions of force), length l of the string and the mass per unit length \u00b5 of string. Derive the formula for frequency. Solution Suppose, that the frequency f depends on the tension raised to the power a, length raised to the power b and mass per unit length raised to the power c. Then, f F l a b c \u221d[ ] [ ] [ ] \u00b5 or f k F l a b c = [ ] [ ] [ ] \u00b5 \u2026(i) Here, k is a dimensionless constant. Thus, [ ] [ ] [ ] [ ] f F l a b c = \u00b5 86 \u0097 Mechanics - I  or [M L T ] [MLT ] [L] [ML ] 0 0 \u20131 \u20132 \u20131 = a b c or [M L T ] M L T 0 0 \u20131 = + + \u2212 \u2212 [ ] a c a b c a 2 For dimensional balance, the dimensions on both sides should be same. Thus, a c + = 0 \u2026(ii) a b c + \u2212 = 0 \u2026(iii) and \u2212 = \u2212 2 1 a \u2026(iv) Solving these three equations, we get a = 1 2 , c = \u22121 2 and b = \u22121 Substituting these values in Eq. (i), we get f k F l = \u2212 \u2212 ( ) ( ) ( ) / / 1 2 1 1 2 \u00b5 or f k l F = \u00b5 Experimentally, the value of k is found to be 1 2 \u22c5 Hence, f l F = 1 2 \u00b5 Limitations of Dimensional Analysis The method of dimensions has the following limitations : (i) By this method, the value of dimensionless constant cannot be calculated. (ii) By this method, the equation containing trigonometrical, exponential and logarithmic terms cannot be analysed. (iii) This method is useful when a physical quantity depends on other quantities by multiplication and power relations. It cannot be used if a physical quantity depends on sum or difference of two quantities. For example we, cannot get the relation, s ut at = + 1 2 2 from dimensional analysis.

A scalar quantity can be described completely by its magnitude only. Addition, subtraction, division or multiplication of scalar quantities can be done according to the ordinary rules of algebra. Mass, volume, density, etc., are few examples of scalar quantities. If a physical quantity in addition to magnitude has a specified direction as well as obeys the law of parallelogram of addition, then and then only it is said to be a vector quantity. Displacement, velocity, acceleration, etc., are few examples of vectors. Any vector quantity should have a specified direction but it is not a sufficient condition for a quantity to be a vector. For example, current flowing in a wire is shown by a direction but it is not a vector because it does not obey the law of parallelogram of vector addition. For example, in the figure shown here. Current flowing in wire OC = current in wire AO + current in wire BO or i i i = + 1 2 was the current a vector quantity, i i i \u2260 + 1 2 It also depends on angle \u03b8, the angle between i1 and i2. 1. Scalar quantities Mass, volume, distance, speed, density, work, power, energy, length, gravitation constant ( ) G , specific heat, specific gravity, charge, current, potential, time, electric or magnetic flux, pressure, surface tension, temperature. 2. Vector quantities Displacement, velocity, acceleration, force, weight, acceleration due to gravity ( ) g , gravitational field strength, electric field, magnetic field, dipole moment, torque, linear momentum, angular momentum. 5.2 General Points Regarding Vectors Vector Notation Usually a vector is represented by a bold capital letter with  an arrow over it, as A, B C , , etc. The magnitude of a vector A is represented by A or | | A and is always positive. Graphical Representation of a Vector Graphically a vector is represented by an arrow drawn to a chosen scale, parallel to the direction of the vector. The length and the direction of the arrow thus represent the magnitude and the direction of the vector respectively. Thus, the arrow in Fig. 5.2 represents a vector A in xy-plane making an angle \u03b8 with x-axis. Steps Involved Representing a Vector (i) By choosing a proper scale, draw a line whose length is proportional to the magnitude of the vector. (ii) By following the standard convention to show direction, indicate the direction of the vector by marking an arrow head at one end of the line. \u03b8 A X Y Fig. 5.2 i1 i2 A O B C i \u03b8 Fig. 5.1  Example To represent the displacement of a body along x-axis. The vector represented by the directed line segment OA in Fig. 5.3 is denoted by OA (to be read as vectorOA) or a simple notation as A (to be read as vector A). For vectorOA,O is the initial point and A is the terminal point. In the figure shown, OA or A is a displacement vector of magnitude 35 km towards east. Note A vector can be displaced from one position to another. During the displacement if we do not change direction and magnitude then the vector remains unchanged. Angle between Two Vectors ( )\u03b8 To find angle between two vectors both the vectors are drawn from one point in such a manner that arrows of both the vectors are outwards from that point. Now, the smaller angle is called the angle between two vectors. For example in Fig. 5.4, angle between A and Bis 60\u00b0 not 120\u00b0.Because in Fig.(a), they are wrongly drawn while in Fig. (b) they are drawn as we desire. Note 0 180 \u00b0 \u2264 \u2264 \u00b0 \u03b8 Kinds of Vectors Unit Vector A vector of unit magnitude is called a unit vector and the notation for it in the direction of A is $A read as \u2018A cap or A caret\u2019. Thus, A A = A $ or $ | | A A A A = = A A unit vector merely indicates a direction. Unit vector along x y , and z-directions are $ $ i, j and $k. Zero Vector or Null Vector A vector having zero magnitude is called a null vector or zero vector. Note (i) Zero vector has no specific direction. (ii) The position vector of origin is a zero vector. (iii) Zero vectors are only of mathematical importance.

Parallel Vectors Vectors are said to be parallel if they have the same directions. The vectors A and B shown in Fig. 5.6 represent parallel vectors. Note Two equal vectors are always parallel but, two parallel vectors may not be equal vectors. Anti-parallel Vectors (Unlike Vectors) Vectors are said to be anti-parallel if they act in opposite direction. The vectors A and B shown in Fig. 5.7 are anti-parallel vectors. Negative Vector The negative vector of any vector is a vector having equal magnitude but acts in opposite direction. Concurrent Vectors (Co-initial Vectors) Vectors having the same initial points are called concurrent vectors or co-initial vectors. A, B and C are concurrent at point O. Coplanar Vectors The vectors lying in the same plane are called coplanar vectors. The vector A and Bare coplanar vectors. The vectors A and B shown in Fig. 5.10 (b) are concurrent coplanar vectors. 100 \u0097 Mechanics - I A B Fig. 5.7 A B C O Fig. 5.9 A B A B O (a) (b) Fig. 5.10 A B Fig. 5.6 A B A B = Fig. 5.5 A B A B = \u2013 or B A = \u2013 Fig. 5.8  Orthogonal Vectors Two vectors are said to be orthogonal if the angle between them is 90\u00b0. The vector shown in Fig. 5.11, A and B are orthogonal to one another. Multiplication and Division of Vectors by Scalars The product of a vector A and a scalar m is a vector mA whose magnitude is m times the magnitude of A and which is in the direction or opposite to A according as the scalar m is positive or negative. Thus, | | m mA A = Further, if m and n are two scalars, then ( ) m n m n + = + A A A and m n n m mn ( ) ( ) ( ) A A A = = The division of vector A by a non-zero scalar m is defined as the multiplication of A by 1 m \u22c5 V Example 5.1 In the shown Fig. 5.12 (a), (b) and (c), find the angle between A and B . Solution If we draw both the vectors from one point with their arrows outwards, then they can be shown as below In Fig. (a), \u03b8 = \u00b0 45 In Fig. (b), \u03b8 = \u00b0 150 and In Fig. (c), \u03b8 = \u00b0 35 Chapter 5 Vectors \u0097 101 45\u00b0 B A A 150\u00b0 B A 145\u00b0 B (b) (c) (a) Fig. 5.12 45\u00b0 B A A 150\u00b0 B 35\u00b0 B A (b) (c) (a) Fig. 5.13 B A Fig. 5.11  V Example 5.2 What is the angle between a and \u22123 2 a. Solution \u22123 2 a has a magnitude equal to 3 2 times the magnitude of a and its direction is opposite to a. Therefore, a and \u22123 2 a are antiparallel to each other or angle between them is 180\u00b0. 5.3 Addition and Subtraction of Two Vectors Addition (i) The parallelogram law Let R be the resultant of two vectors A and B. According to parallelogram law of vector addition, the resultant R is the diagonal of the parallelogram of which A and Bare the adjacent sides as shown in figure. Magnitude of R is given by R A B ",

(i) and (ii). (ii) The triangle law According to this law, if the tail of one vector be placed at the head of the other, their sum or resultant R is drawn from the tail end of the first to the head end of the other. As is evident from the figure that the resultant R is the same irrespective of the order in which the vectors A and B are taken, Thus, R A B B A = + = + Subtraction Negative of a vector say \u2212A is a vector of the same magnitude as vector A but pointing in a direction opposite to that of A. 102 \u0097 Mechanics - I A B R \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b8 Fig. 5.15 a 3 2 \u2212 a Fig. 5.14 R B A B A R Fig. 5.16 A \u2013 A Fig. 5.17  Thus, A B \u2212 can be written as A B + \u2212 ( ) or A B \u2212 is really the vector addition of A and \u2212B.

The most important components with which we are concerned are mutually perpendicular or rectangular ones along the three co-ordinate axes ox, oy and oz respectively. Thus, a vector R can be written as R i j k = + + R R R x y z $ $ $. Here, Rx, R y and R z are the components of R in x, y and z-axes respectively and $, $ i j and $k are unit vectors along these directions.

The vector Cis normal to the plane of A and Band points in the direction in which a right handed screw would advance when rotated about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the two vectors in the direction from A to B through the smaller angle \u03b8 between them or alternatively, we might state the rule as below If the fingers of the right hand be curled in the direction in which vector A must be turned through the smaller included angle \u03b8 to coincide with the direction of vector B, the thumb points in the direction of C as shown in Fig. 5.33. Either of these rules is referred to as the right handed screw rule.

The moment of inertia has two forms, a scalar form I (used when the axis of rotation is known) and a more general tensor form that does not require knowing the axis of rotation. Although tensor is a generalized term which is characterized by its rank. For example, scalars are tensors of rank zero. Vectors are tensors of rank two. 2. Pressure is a scalar quantity, not a vector quantity. It has magnitude but no direction sense associated with it. Pressure acts in all directions at a point inside a fluid. 3. Surface tension is scalar because it has no specific direction. 4. Stress is neither a scalar nor a vector quantity, it is a tensor. 5. To qualify as a vector, a physical quantity must not only possess magnitude and direction but must also satisfy the parallelogram law of vector addition. For instance, the finite rotation of a rigid body about a given axis has magnitude (the angle of rotation) and also direction (the direction of the axis) but it is not a vector quantity. This is so for the simple reason that the two finite rotations of the body do not add up in accordance with the law of vector addition. However if the rotation be small or infinitesimal, it may be regarded as a vector quantity. 6. Area can behave either as a scalar or a vector and how it behaves depends on circumstances. 7. Area (vector), dipole moment and current density are defined as vectors with specific direction. 8. Vectors associated with a linear or directional effect are called polar vectors or simply as vectors and those associated with rotation about an axis are referred to as axial vectors. Thus, force, linear velocity and linear acceleration are polar vectors and angular velocity, angular acceleration are axial vectors. 9.

Position and motion of a body can be determined only with respect to other bodies. Motion of the body involves position and time. For practical purposes a coordinate system, e.g. the cartesian system is fixed to the reference body and position of the body is determined with respect to this reference body. For calculation of time generally clock is used. Kinematics is the branch of mechanics which deals with the motion regardless of the causes producing it. The study of causes of motion is called dynamics. 6.2 Few General Points of Motion Kinematics is the branch of mechanics which deals with the motion regardless of the causes producing it. 1. Direction of velocity is in the direction of motion. But direction of acceleration is not necessarily in the direction of motion. Direction of acceleration is in the direction of net force acting on the body. For example, if we say that a body is moving due east, it means velocity of the body is towards east. From the above statement, we cannot find the direction of acceleration. 2. Motion in a straight line is called a one-dimensional motion. 3. Motion which is not one dimensional is called a curvilinear motion. Circular motion and projectile motion are the examples of curvilinear motion. 4. Direction of velocity at any point on a curvilinear path is tangential to the path. But with direction of acceleration there is no such condition. As we have stated earlier also, it is in the direction of net force. For example, in the figure shown below a particle is moving on a curvilinear path. At point P, velocity of the particle is tangential to the path but acceleration is making an angle \u03b8 with velocity. If \u03b8 is acute ( ) 0 90 \u00b0 \u2264 < \u00b0 \u03b8 , then speed (which is also magnitude of velocity vector) of the particle increases. If \u03b8 is obtuse ( ) 90 180 \u00b0 < \u2264 \u00b0 \u03b8 , then speed of the particle decreases. Note \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 is a special case when speed remains constant. This point we shall discuss in our later discussions.

Solution Magnitude of velocity vector at any instant of time is the speed of particle. Hence, Speed = v or | | ( ) ( ) ( ) v = + + 3 4 5 2 2 2 = 5 2 m/s Ans. V Example 6.2 \u201cA lift is ascending with decreasing speed\u201d. What are the directions of velocity and acceleration of the lift at the given instant. Solution (i) Direction of motion is the direction of velocity. Lift is ascending (means it is moving upwards). So, direction of velocity is upwards. (ii) Speed of lift is decreasing. So, direction of acceleration should be in opposite direction or it should be downwards. 1. \u2018\u2018A lift is descending with increasing speed\u2019\u2019. What are the directions of velocity and acceleration in the given statement? 2. Velocity and acceleration of a particle at some instant are v = \u2212 + ( $ $ $ ) 3 4 2 i j k m/s and a i j k = + \u2212 ( $ $ $) 2 2 2 m /s (a) What is the value of dot product of v and a at the given instant? (b) What is the angle between v and a, acute, obtuse or 90\u00b0? (c) At the given instant, whether speed of the particle is increasing, decreasing or constant? 6.3 Classification of Motion A motion can be classified in following two ways : First According to this way, a motion can be either (i) One dimensional (1-D) (ii) Two dimensional (2-D) (iii) Three dimensional (3-D) In one dimensional motion, particle (or a body) moves in a straight line, in two dimensional motion, it moves in a plane and in three dimensional motion body moves in space. Second According to this way, a motion can be either (i) Uniform motion (ii) Uniformly accelerated (iii) Non-uniformly accelerated. In uniform motion, velocity of the particle is constant and in non-uniformly accelerated motion acceleration of the particle is not constant. Equations, v u a = + t etc. can be applied directly, only for uniformly accelerated motion. If the motion is one dimensional then these equations can be written as, v u at = + etc. For solving a problem of non-uniform acceleration, either integration or differentiation is required. Chapter 6 Kinematics \u0097 129 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 6.1  In uniform motion, velocity of particle is constant, therefore acceleration is zero. Velocity is constant, means its magnitude (or speed) is constant and direction of velocity is fixed. So, the particle moves in a straight line. Hence, it is always one dimensional motion. V Example 6.3 Give two examples of two dimensional motion. Solution Two dimensional motion takes place in a plane. Its two examples are circular motion and projectile motion. Normally, the plane of circular motion is either horizontal or vertical and plane of projectile motion is vertical. V Example 6.4 Velocity of a particle is v i j k = + \u2212 ( $ $ $ ) / 2 3 4 m s and its acceleration is zero. State whether it is 1-D, 2-D or 3-D motion? Solution Since, acceleration of the particle is zero. Therefore, it is uniform motion or motion in a straight line. So, it is one dimensional motion. V Example 6.5 Projectile motion is a two dimensional motion with constant acceleration. Is this statement true or false? Solution True. Projectile motion takes place in a plane. So, it is two dimensional. For small heights, its acceleration is constant (= acceleration due to gravity). Therefore, it is a two dimensional motion with constant acceleration. 1.

Find (a) time period of the particle. (b) average speed, average velocity and average acceleration in a time interval from t = 0 to t T = / .4 Here, T is the time period of the particle. Give only their magnitudes. 6.5 Uniform Motion As we have discussed earlier also, in uniform motion velocity of the particle is constant and acceleration is zero. Velocity is constant means its magnitude (called speed) is constant and direction is fixed. Therefore, motion is 1-D in same direction. If velocity is along positive direction, then displacement is also along positive direction. Therefore, distance travelled (d) is equal to the displacement (s). If velocity is along negative direction then displacement is also negative and distance travelled in this case is the magnitude of displacement. Equations involved in this motion are (i) Velocity (may be positive or negative) = constant (ii) Speed, v = constant (iii) Acceleration = 0 (iv) Displacement (may be positive or negative) = velocity \u00d7 time (v) Distance = speed \u00d7 time or d vt = (vi) Distance and speed are always positive, whereas displacement and velocity may be positive or negative.

Find average speed during the complete journey. 6.6 One Dimensional Motion with Uniform Acceleration As we have discussed in article 6.3 that equations like v u a = + t etc. can be applied directly with constant (or uniform) acceleration. Further, in one dimensional motion, all vector quantities (displacement, velocity and acceleration) can be treated like scalars by using sign convention method. In this method, one direction is taken as positive and the other as the negative and then all vector quantities are written with paper signs. In most of the cases, we will take following sign convention. The equations used in 1-D motion with uniform acceleration are v u at = + ...(i) v u as 2 2 2 = + ...(ii) s ut at = + 1 2 2 ...(iii) s s ut at 1 0 2 1 2 = + + ...(iv) s u at a t = + \u22121 2 ...(v) In the above equations, u = initial velocity, v = velocity at time t, a = constant acceleration s = displacement measured from the starting point Here, starting point means the point where the particle was at t = 0. It is not the point where u = 0. s1 = displacement measured from any other point, say P, where P is not the starting point. s0 = displacement of the starting point from P. st = displacement (not the distance in t th second). 136 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u2013ve +ve \u2013ve +ve In horizontal 1-D motion In vertical 1-D motion Fig. 6.10 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 6.4  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 In most of the cases, displacement is measured from the starting point, therefore Eq. (iii) or s ut at = + 1 2 2 is used. \u0098 For small heights, if the motion is taking place under gravity then acceleration is always constant (= acceleration due to gravity). This is 9.8 m / s ( 10 m / s ) 2 2 \u2248 in downward direction. According to our sign convention downward direction is negative. Therefore, a g = = \u2248\u2212 9.8 m/s 10 m/s 2 2 \u0098 One-dimensional motion (with constant acceleration) can be observed in following three cases: Case 1 Initial velocity is zero. Case 2 Initial velocity is parallel to constant acceleration. Case 3 Initial velocity is antiparallel to constant acceleration. In first two cases, motion is only accelerated and direction of motion does not change. In the third case, motion is first retarded (till the velocity becomes zero) and then accelerated in opposite direction. \u0098 In most of the problems of time calculations, s ut at = + 1 2 2 equation is useful. But s has to be measured from the starting point. \u0098 In case 3 (of point 3), we need not to apply two separate equations, one for retarded motion (when motion is upwards) and other for accelerated motion (when motion is downwards). Problem can be solved by applying the equations only one time, provided s (in s ut at = + 1 2 2) is measured from the starting point and all vector quantities are substituted with proper signs. V Example 6.13 A ball is thrown upwards from the top of a tower 40 m high with a velocity of 10 m/s. Find the time when it strikes the ground. Take g = 10 m/s2. Solution In the problem, u = + 10 m/s, a = \u221210 m/s 2 and s = \u221240 m (at the point where stone strikes the ground) Substituting in s ut at = + 1 2 2,  we have \u2212 = \u2212 40 10 5 2 t t or 5 10 40 0 2t t \u2212 \u2212 = or t t 2 2 8 0 \u2212 \u2212 = Solving this, we have t = 4 s and \u22122s.

The ball is at a height of 80 m at two times, the time interval being 6 s. Find u. Take g m/s = 10 2. Solution Here, u u = m/s, a g = = \u221210 m/s 2 and s = 80 m. Substituting the values in s ut at = + 1 2 2, we  have 80 5 2 = \u2212 ut t or 5 80 0 2t ut \u2212 + = or t u u = + \u2212 2 1600 10 and u u \u2212 \u2212 2 1600 10 Now, it is given that u u u u + \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 \u2212 = 2 2 1600 10 1600 10 6 or u2 1600 5 6 \u2212 = or u2 1600 30 \u2212 = or u2 1600 900 \u2212 = \u2234 u2 2500 = or u = \u00b1 50m/s Ignoring the negative sign, we have u = 50 m/s \u0098 In motion under gravity, we can use the following results directly in objective problems: (a) If a particle is projected upwards with velocity u , then (i) maximum height attained by the particle, h u g = 2 2 (ii) time of ascent = time of descent = u g \u21d2\u2234Total time of flight = 2u g (b) If a particle is released from rest from a height h (also called free fall), then (i) velocity of particle at the time of striking with ground, v gh = 2 (ii) time of descent (also called free fall time) t h g = 2 Note In the above results, air resistance has been neglected and we have already substituted the signs of u, g etc. So, you have to substitute only their magnitudes. \u0098 Exercise Derive the above results. 138 \u0097 Mechanics - I u s = 80 m +ve \u2013ve Fig. 6.14 t = 0 t = 2 s t = \u2013 2 s A B D t = 1 s ",

By limit we mean the value of physical quantity which we will get after integration should be known at some given time. For example, after integrating v (w.r.t time) we will get displacement s. Therefore, to get complete s function value of s should be known at some given time. Otherwise constant of integration remains as an unknown. Thus, a t v t s t - - - \u2192 \u2192 (integration with limits) Chapter 6 Kinematics \u0097 141  Derivation of Equation of Motion (v u at = + etc.) For one dimensional motion with a = constant.

Chapter 6 Kinematics \u0097 143 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 6.6  144 \u0097 Mechanics - I Extra Points to Remember 6.8 Motion in Two and Three Dimensions The motion of a particle thrown in a vertical plane at some angle with horizontal ( ) \u2260 \u00b0 90 is an example of two dimensional motion. Similarly, a circular motion is also an example of 2-D motion. A two dimensional motion takes place in a plane. In most of the cases plane of circular motion is horizontal or vertical. According to nature of acceleration we can classify this motion in following two types. Uniform Acceleration Equations of motion for uniformly accelerated motion (a = constant) are as under v u a = + t, s u a = + t t 1 2 2, v v u u a s \u2022 \u2022 \u2022 = + 2 Here, u = initial velocity of particle, v = velocity of particle at time t and s = displacement of particle in time t Note If initial position vector of a particle is r0, then position vector at time t can be written as r r s r u = + = + + 0 0 2 1 2 t t a Non-Uniform Acceleration When acceleration is not constant then we will have to go for differentiation or integration. The equations in differentiation are (i) v s = d dt or d dt r (ii) a v = d dt Here, v and a are instantaneous velocity, acceleration vectors. The equations of integration are (iii) ds v \u222b \u222b = dt and (iv) dv a \u222b \u222b = dt A two or three dimensional motion can also be solved by component method. For example, in two dimensional motion (in x-y plane) the motion can be resolved along x and y directions. Now, along these two directions we can use sign method, as we used in one-dimensional motion (but separately). By separately we mean, when we are looking the motion along x-axis we need not to bother about the motion along y-axis. V Example 6.18 A particle of mass 1 kg has a velocity of 2 m/s. A constant force of 2 N acts on the particle for 1 s in a direction perpendicular to its initial velocity. Find the velocity and displacement of the particle at the end of 1 s. Solution Force acting on the particle is constant. Hence, acceleration of the particle will also remain constant. a F m = = = 2 1 2 m s 2 /  Since, acceleration is constant. We can apply v u a = + t and s u a = + t t 1 2 2 Refer Fig. 6.17 (a) v u a = + t Here, u and a t are two mutually perpendicular vectors. So, | | (| | ) (| | ) v u a = + 2 2 t = + ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 2 = 2 2 m s/ \u03b1 = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 \u2212 tan | | | | tan 1 1 2 2 a u t = = \u00b0 \u2212 tan ( ) 1 1 45 Thus, velocity of the particle at the end of 1s is 2 2 m/s at an angle of 45\u00b0 with its initial velocity. Refer Fig. 6.17 (b), s u a = + t t 1 2 2 Here, u t and 1 2 2 a t are also two mutually perpendicular vectors. So, | | (| | ) (| | ) s u a = + t t 2 2 2 1 2 = + ( ) ( ) 2 1 2 2 = 5 m and \u03b2 = \u2212 tan | | 1 2 1 2 a u t t = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 tan 1 1 2 Thus, displacement of the particle at the end of 1 s is 5 m at an angle of tan \u2212\uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 1 2 from its initial velocity.

Find the velocity and displacement of particle at t s = 2 . Solution Here, acceleration a i j = + ( $ $) 4 2 m/s 2 is constant.

Find velocity and coordinates of particle att = 1s. 6.9 Graphs Before studying graphs of kinematics, let us first discuss some general points : (i) Mostly a graph is drawn between two variable quantities (say x and y ). In kinematics, the frequently asked graphs are s-t, v-t, a-t or v-s. (ii) Equation between x and y will decide the shape of graph whether it is straight line, circle, parabola or rectangular hyperbola etc. If the equation is linear, graph is a straight line. If equation is quadratic then graph is a parabola. In kinematics, most of the graphs are straight line or parabola. (iii) By putting x = 0in y-x equation if we get y = 0, then graph passes through origin, otherwise not. (iv) If z dy dx = , then the value of zat any point can be obtained by the slope of the graph at that point. For example, instantaneous velocity v ds dt = = slope of s-t graph. instantaneous acceleration a dv dt = = slope of v-t graph. (v) If dz y dx = . Then, dz ydx \u222b \u222b = \u21d2z or z z f i \u2212 or \u2206z = area under y-x graph, with projection along x-axis. For example, ds vdt = \u21d2Displacement s vdt = = \u222b area under v-t graph with projection along t-axis. Further, dv adt = \u21d2v v f i \u2212 or \u2206v adt = = \u222b area under a-t graph with projection along t-axis. These results have been summarized in following table : Chapter 6 Kinematics \u0097 147 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 6.7  Table 6.2 Name of Graph Slope Area s-t v No physical quantity v-t a s a-t Rate of change of acceleration v v f i \u2212 or \u2206v For better understanding of three graphs (s-t, v-t and a-t) of kinematics, we have classified the one dimensional motion in following four types. Uniform Motion Equations The three equations of uniform motion are as under a v = = 0, constant and s vt = or s s vt = + 0 Important Points (i) s-t equation is linear. Therefore, s-t graph is straight line. (ii) In s vt = , displacement is measured from the starting point ( ) t = 0 . Corresponding to this equation s-t graph passes through origin, as s = 0 when t = 0. In s s vt = + 0 , displacement is measured from any other point and s0 is the initial displacement. (iii) Slope of s-t graph = v. Now, since v = constant, therefore slope of s-t graph = constant. (iv) Slope of v-t graph = a. Now, since a = 0, therefore slope of v-t graph = 0. The Corresponding Graphs V Example 6.21 s-t graph of a particle in motion is as shown below. (a) State, whether the given graph represents a uniform motion or not. (b) Find velocity of the particle.

Therefore, velocity is positive and constant. (ii) v dx dt = = slope of x-t graph = + 20 10 = + 2 m/s Therefore, velocity is 2 m/s along positive x-direction.

Therefore, v-t graph is a straight line. Further, v at = is a straight line passing through origin (as v = 0 when t = 0 ) (ii) All s-t equations are quadratic. Therefore, all s-t graphs should be parabolic. (iii) Slope of s-t graph gives the instantaneous velocity. Therefore, initial slope of s-t graph gives initial velocity u. In this case, we are considering only accelerated motion (in which speed keeps on increasing in positive direction). Therefore, velocity is positive and continuously increasing. Hence, slope of s-t graph should be positive and should keep on increasing. (iv) Slope of v-t graph gives instantaneous acceleration. Now, acceleration is positive and constant.

Therefore, v-t straight line cannot pass through origin. Further, initial slope of s-t parabolic graph cannot be zero. (ii) Velocity is positive but keeps on decreasing from u to zero. (iii) Slope of v-t graph gives instantaneous acceleration. Acceleration is constant and negative. Therefore, slope of v-t graph should be negative and constant. (iv) Initial slope of s-t graph will give us initial velocity u. Final slope of s-t graph will give us final velocity zero. In between these two times, velocity is positive and decreasing. Therefore, slope of s-t graph (= instantaneous velocity) should be positive and decreasing. Graphs tan \u03b81 = initial slope = u From O to P, slope or v is positive but decreasing. At P, slope = 0, therefore v = 0 Uniformly Retarded and then Accelerated Motion in Opposite Direction If a particle is projected upwards then first it is retarded in upward (say positive) direction. At highest point its velocity becomes zero and finally it is retarded in downward (or negative) direction. Throughout the motion, its acceleration is downwards and constant (= acceleration due to gravity). Therefore, it is negative and constant. If air resistance is neglected, then speed of the particle at the time of projection is equal to speed at the time of striking with the ground. But velocities are in opposite directions. So, their signs are different. During retardation, velocity is upwards (therefore positive) but decreasing. During acceleration, velocity is downwards (therefore negative) and increasing. Upward journey time is equal to the downward journey time. Finally, the particle returns to the ground. Therefore final displacement is zero. In upward journey, displacement increases (parabolically) in positive direction. In downward journey, it decreases. But displacement from the starting point (ground) is still positive. Slope of s-t graphs gives the instantaneous velocity. In upward journey, velocity is positive and decreasing. Therefore, slope is positive and decreasing. At highest point velocity is zero. Therefore, slope is zero. In downward journey, velocity is negative and increasing. Therefore, slope is negative and increasing.

At this point, v u = \u2212 \u21d2slope of s-t graph = = \u2212 tan \u03b8 2 u At this point, s = 0 (v) Upwards journey time tOA = downward journey time t AB (vi) In upward motion (from O to A), velocity is positive and decreasing. Therefore, slope of s-t graph is positive and decreasing. (vii) In downward motion (from A to B), velocity is negative and increasing. Therefore, slope of s-t graph is negative and increasing. \u0098 Slope of v-t or s-t graph can never be infinite at any point, because infinite slope of v-t graph means infinite acceleration. Similarly, infinite slope of s-t graph means infinite velocity.

Hence, the following graphs are not acceptable : \u0098 Time never returns. Therefore, on time axis we will always move ahead. On this ground, following graph cannot exist in real life : \u0098 Different values of displacements in s-t graph corresponding to given v-t graph can be obtained just by calculating area under v-t graph. There is no need of using equations like s ut at = + 1 2 2 etc. V Example 6.23 Acceleration-time graph of a particle moving in a straight line is as shown in Fig. 6.28.

Solution (a) Let the car accelerates for time t1and decelerates for time t 2. Then, t t t = + 1 2 \u2026(i) and corresponding velocity-time graph will be as shown in Fig. 6.32.

Solution From t = 0 to t = 2s, a = + 2 m/s 2 \u2234 v at t = = 2 or v-t graph is a straight line passing through origin with slope 2 m/s 2. At the end of 2 s, v = \u00d7 = 2 2 4 m/s From t = 2to 4 s, a = 0. Hence, v = 4 m/s will remain constant. From t = 4 to 6 s, a = \u22124 m/s 2. Hence, v u at t = \u2212 = \u2212 4 4 (with t = 0at 4 s) v = 0at t = 1s or at 5 s from origin. At the end of 6 s (or t = 2s) v = \u22124 m/s. Corresponding v-t graph is as shown in Fig. 6.34. 1.

Questions based on relative motion are usually of following four types : (a) Minimum distance or collision or overtaking problems (b) River-boat problems (c) Aircraft-wind problems (d) Rain problems Minimum Distance or Collision or Overtaking Problems When two bodies are in motion, the questions like, the minimum distance between them or the time when one body overtakes the other can be solved easily by the principle of relative motion. In these type of problems, one body is assumed to be at rest and the relative motion of the other body is considered. By assuming so, two body problem is converted into one body problem and the solution becomes easy. Following example will illustrate the statement: V Example 6.29 Car A and car B start moving simultaneously in the same direction along the line joining them. Car A moves with a constant acceleration a m s = 4 2 / , while car B moves with a constant velocity v = 1 m/s. At time t = 0, car A is 10 m behind car B. Find the time when car A overtakes car B.

Here, it is important to note that v br is the velocity of boatman with which he steers and v b is the actual velocity of boatman relative to ground. Further, v v v b br r = + (as v v v br b r = \u2212 ) Now, let us derive some standard results and their special cases. A boatman starts from point A on one bank of a river with velocity v br in the direction shown in Fig. 6.47. River is flowing along positive x-direction with velocity v r . Width of the river is \u03c9, then v v v b r br = + Therefore, v v v v v bx rx brx r br = + = \u2212 sin \u03b8 and v v v by ry bry = + = + = 0 v v br br cos cos \u03b8 \u03b8 Now, time taken by the boatman to cross the river is t v v by br = = \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b8 cos or t vbr = \u03c9 \u03b8 cos \u2026(i) Further, displacement along x-axis when he reaches the other bank (also called drift) is x v t v v v bx r br br = = \u2212 ( sin ) cos \u03b8 \u03c9 \u03b8 or x v v v r br br = \u2212 ( sin ) cos \u03b8 \u03c9 \u03b8 \u2026(ii) Three special cases are: (i) Condition when the boatman crosses the river in shortest interval of time From Eq. (i) we can see that time (t) will be minimum when \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 , i.e. the boatman should steer his boat perpendicular to the river current. Also, t vbr min = \u03c9 as cos \u03b8 =1 Chapter 6 Kinematics \u0097 161 A B vr vbr \u03c9 y x \u03b8 Fig. 6.47 vr vbr B A Fig. 6.48  Extra Points to Remember (ii) Condition when the boatman wants to reach point B, i.e. at a point just opposite from where he started In this case, the drift (x) should be zero. \u2234 x = 0 or ( sin ) cos v v v r br br \u2212 = \u03b8 \u03c9 \u03b8 0 or v v r br = sin \u03b8 or sin \u03b8 = v v r br or \u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 sin 1 v v r br Hence, to reach point B the boatman should row at an angle\u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 sin 1 v v r br upstream from AB. Further, since sin | \u03b8 >1 . So, if v v r br \u2265 , the boatman can never reach at point B. Because if v v r br = = , sin \u03b8 1or \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 and it is just impossible to reach at B if \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 . Moreover, it can be seen that vb = 0 if v v r br = = \u00b0 and \u03b8 90 . Similarly, if v v r br > ,sin \u03b8 >1, i.e. no such angle exists. Practically, it can be realized in this manner that it is not possible to reach at B if river velocity ( ) vr is too high. \u0098 In a general case, resolve vbr along the river and perpendicular to river as shown below. Now, the boatman will cross the river with component of vbr perpendicular to river( sin = vbr \u03b1 in above case) \u2234 t vbr = \u03c9 \u03b1 sin To cross the river in minimum time, why to take help of component of vbr (which is always less that vbr ), the complete vector vbr should be kept perpendicular to the river current. Due to the other component v v r br + cos \u03b1, boatman will drift along the river by a distance x v v r br = + ( cos )( ) \u03b1 time \u0098 To reach a point B, which is just opposite to the starting point A, net velocity of boatman vb or the vector sum of vr and vbr should be along AB.

(i), we can see that this case is possible if, v v br r > otherwise, vb is either zero or imaginary. \u0098 If the boatman rows his boat along the river (downstream), then net velocity of boatman will be v v br r + . If he rows along the river upstream then net velocity of boatman will be v v br r ~ .

Further, v v v a aw w = + . In this case, problem is slightly different.

If a particle is just dropped from a moving body then just after dropping, velocity of the particle (not acceleration) is equal to the velocity of the moving body at that instant. For example, if a stone is dropped from a moving train with velocity 20 m/s, then initial velocity of the stone is 20 m/s horizontal in the direction of motion of train. But, after dropping it comes under gravity. Therefore, its acceleration is g downwards. 2. If y (may be velocity, acceleration etc.) is a function of time or y f t = ( ) and we want to find the average value of y between a time interval of t1 and t2. Then, < > = y t t 1 2 to average value of y between t1and t2 = \u2212 \u222b f t dt t t t t ( ) 1 2 2 1 or < > = \u2212 \u222b y f t dt t t t t t t 1 2 1 2 2 1 to ( ) If f t( ) is a linear function of t, then y y y f i av = + 2 Here, yf = final value of y and yi = initial value of y At the same time, we should not forget that v av total displacement total time = and aav change in velocity total time = Example In one dimensional uniformly accelerated motion, find average velocity between a time interval from t = 0 to t t = .

A particle is thrown upwards with velocity u. Suppose it takes time t to reach its highest point, then distance travelled in last second is independent of u. This is because this distance is equal to the distance travelled in first second of a freely falling object. Thus, s g = \u00d7 1 2 1 2 ( ) = \u00d7 \u00d7 = 1 2 10 1 5 m Exercise: A particle is thrown upwards with velocity u m s ( / ). > 20 Prove that distance travelled in last 2 s is 20 m. 4.

The magnitude of instantaneous velocity is called the instantaneous speed, i.e. v d dt | | = = v r Speed is not equal to dr dt , i.e. v dr dt \u2260 where, r is the modulus of radius vectorr because in general| | d dr r \u2260 . For example, whenr changes only in direction, i.e. if a point moves in a circle, then r = constant, dr = 0 but |d r | \u22600. 6. Suppose C is a vector sum of two vectors A and B and the direction of C is given to us (along PQ), then A B + should be along PQ or sum of components of A andB perpendicular to line PQ should be zero. For instance, in example 6.33, va has to be along AB and we know that v v v a aw w = + .

Then, deal different axis separately as one dimension by assigning proper signs to all vector quantities. While dealing x-direction, we don't have to bother about y and z-directions.

General method of conversion of graph Concept (i) In some cases, one graph can be converted into the other graph just by finding slope of the given graph. But this method is helpful when different segments of the given graph are straight lines. For example, (a) Given s-t graph can be converted into the v-t graph from the slope of s-t graph as v ds dt = = slope of s-t graph (b) Given v-t graph can be converted into the a-t graph from the slope of v-t graph, as a dv dt = = slope of v-t graph (ii) In few cases, we have to convert given y-x graph into z-x graph. For example, suppose we have to convert v-s graph into a-s graph. In such cases, first you make v-s equation (if it is straight line graph) from the given v-s graph. Then, with the help of this v-s equation and some standard equations (like a v dv ds = \u22c5 ) make a-s equation and now draw a-s graph corresponding to this a-s equation. V Example 6 A particle is moving along x-axis. Its x-coordinate versus time graph is as shown below. Plot v-t graph corresponding to this. Chapter 6 Kinematics \u0097 179 4 O \u20138 4 6 10 14 t s ( ) x m ( )  Solution v dx dt = = slope of x-t graph. Slope for different time intervals is given in following table.

Solution The given v-s graph is a straight line with positive slope (say m) and positive intercept (say c ). Therefore, v-s equation is v ms c = + \u21d2 dv ds m = Now, a v dv ds = \u22c5 = + ( ) ( ) ms c m a m s mc = + 2 a-s equation is a linear equation. Therefore, a-s graph is also a straight line with positive slope ( ) = m2 and positive intercept ( ) = mc . a-s graph is as shown below. 180 \u0097 Mechanics - I 2 O \u20132 t s ( ) v(m/s) 4 10 14 v s a s  Type 7. Based on difference between distance and displacement Concept There is no direct formula for calculation of distance. In the formula, s ut at = + 1 2 2 s = displacement, not the distance So, you will have to convert the given distance into proper displacement and then apply the above equation. V Example 8 A particle is moving along x-axis. At time t = 0, its x-coordinate is x m = \u22124 . Its velocity-time equation is v t = \u2212 8 2 where, v is in m/s and t in seconds. (a) At how many times, particle is at a distance of 8 m from the origin? (b) Find those times. Solution (a) Comparing the given v-t equation with v u at = + . We have, u = 8 m/s and a = \u2212 = 2 2 m/s constant Now, motion of the particle is as shown below. Now, 8 m distance from origin will be at two coordinates x = 8 m and x = \u22128 m. From the diagram, we can see that particle will cross these two points three times, t t 1 2 , and t3. (b)t t 1 2 and : At x = 8 m, displacement from the starting point is s x x f i = \u2212 = \u2212\u2212 = 8 4 12 ( ) m Substituting in s ut at = + 1 2 2, we have 12 8 1 2 2 2 = \u2212 \u00d7 \u00d7 t t Solving this equation, we get smaller time t1 2 = s Ans. and larger time t2 6 = s Ans. t3 : At x = \u22128 m, displacement from the starting point is s x x f i = \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212\u2212 = \u2212 8 4 4 ( ) m Substituting in s ut at = + 1 2 2, we have \u2212 = \u2212 \u00d7 \u00d7 4 8 1 2 2 2 t t Solving this equation, we get the positive time, t3 = 8.47 s Ans.

Motion is one dimensional under following three conditions : (i) Initial velocity of the particle is zero. (ii) Initial velocity of the particle is in the direction of constant acceleration (or parallel to it). (iii) Initial velocity of the particle is in the opposite direction of constant acceleration (or antiparallel to it). For small heights acceleration due to gravity (g) is almost constant. The three cases discussed about are as shown in the Fig. 7.1. In all other cases when initial velocity is at some angle (\u2260\u00b0 0 or 180\u00b0) with constant acceleration, motion is parabolic as shown below. This motion under acceleration due to gravity is called projectile motion. 7.2 Projectile Motion As we have seen above, projectile motion is a two-dimensional motion (or motion in a plane) with constant acceleration (or acceleration due to gravity for small heights). The different types of projectile motion are as shown below. g u = 0 Case-(i) g u Case-(ii) g Case-(iii) u Fig. 7.1 u g \u03b8 Fig. 7.2 (a) u (b) u (c) u  The plane of the projectile motion is a vertical plane. 7.3 Two Methods of Solving a Projectile Motion Every projectile motion can be solved by either of the following two methods: Method 1 Projectile motion is a two dimensional motion with constant acceleration. Therefore, we can use the equations v u a = + t and s u a = + t t 1 2 2 For example, in the shown figure u = + u u cos $ sin $ \u03b1 \u03b1 i j and a = \u2212g$j Now, suppose we want to find velocity at time t. v u a = + t = + \u2212 ( cos $ sin $) $ u u gt \u03b1 \u03b1 i j j or v = + \u2212 u u gt cos $ ( sin ) $ \u03b1 \u03b1 i j Similarly, displacement at time t will be s u a = + t t 1 2 2 = + \u2212 ( cos $ sin $) $ u u t gt \u03b1 \u03b1 i j j 1 2 2 = + \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ut ut gt cos $ sin $ \u03b1 \u03b1 i j 1 2 2 Note In all problems, value of a g ( ) = will be same only u will be different.

Alternate method a g = Angle between u and a is \u03b1 \u03b8 = \u00b0 + 90 Now, Eq. (i) can be written as u u u a \u22c5 + \u22c5 = t 0 or u ug t 2 0 + = ( cos ) \u03b1 or u ug t 2 90 0 + \u00b0 + = [ cos ( )] \u03b8 Solving this equation, we get t u g u g = = sin \u03b8 \u03b8 cosec Ans. Method 2 In this method, select two mutually perpendicular directions x and y and find the two components of initial velocity and acceleration along these two directions, i.e. find ux, uy, ax and a y. Now apply the appropriate equation (s) of the following six equations : v u a t s u t a t v u a s x x x x x x x x x x x = + = + = + \uf8f9 \uf8fb \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fa \u2192 1 2 2 2 2 2 Along - axis and v u a t s u t a t v u a s y y y y y y y y y y y = + = + = + \uf8f9 \uf8fb \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fa \uf8fa \u2192 1 2 2 2 2 2 Along - axis Substitute vx, ux, ax, sx,v y , uy, a y and sy with proper signs but choosing one direction as positive and other as the negative along both axes. In most of the problems s ut at = + 1 2 2 equation is useful for time calculation. Under normal projectile motion, x-axis is taken along horizontal direction and y-axis along vertical direction. In projectile motion along an inclined plane, x-axis is normally taken along the plane and y-axis perpendicular to the plane. Two simple cases are shown below.

Find (a) the time taken by the projectile to reach the ground, (b) the distance of the point where the particle hits the ground from foot of the hill and (c) the velocity with which the projectile hits the ground. (g = 9.8 m/s2 ) Solution Here, it will be more convenient to choose x and y directions as shown in figure. Here, u a x x = 98 m/s, = 0, u y = 0 and a g y = (a) At A, sy = 490 m. So, applying s u t a t y y y = + 1 2 2 \u2234 490 0 1 2 2 = + (9.8) t \u2234 t = 10s Ans. (b) BA s u t a t x x x = = + 1 2 2 or BA = + ( )( ) 98 10 0 or BA = 980 m Ans. (c) v u a t x x x = + = + 98 0 = 98 m/s v u a t y y y = + = + = 0 10 98 (9.8) ( ) m/s \u2234 v v v x y = + = + = 2 2 2 2 98 98 98 2 ( ) ( ) / m s and tan \u03b2 = = = v v y x 98 98 1 \u2234 \u03b2 = \u00b0 45 Thus, the projectile hits the ground with velocity 98 2 m/s at an angle of \u03b2 = \u00b0 45 with horizontal as shown in Fig. 7.9. V Example 7.4 A body is thrown horizontally from the top of a tower and strikes the ground after three seconds at an angle of 45\u00b0 with the horizontal. Find the height of the tower and the speed with which the body was projected. Take g m s = 9.8 / . 2 220 \u0097 Mechanics - I O \u03b2 vy vx A B x y u = 98 m/s Fig. 7.9  Solution As shown in the figure of Example 7.3. u y = 0 and a g y = = 9.8 m s 2 / , s u t a t y y y = + 1 2 2 sy = \u00d7 + \u00d7 \u00d7 0 3 1 2 3 2 9.8 ( ) = 44.1m Thus, height of the tower is 44.1 m. Further, v u a t y y y = + = + 0 3 ( ) ( ) 9.8 = 29.4 m s/ As the resultant velocity v makes an angle of 45\u00b0 with the horizontal, so tan 45\u00b0 = v v y x or 1= 29.4 vx vx = 29.4 m s/ v u a t x x x = + \u21d2 29.4 = + ux 0 or ux = 29.4 m/s Therefore, the speed with which the body was projected (horizontally) is 29.4 m/s. 1. Two particles are projected from a tower horizontally in opposite directions with velocities 10 m/s and 20 m/s. Find the time when their velocity vectors are mutually perpendicular. Take g =10 2 m/s . 2. Projectile motion is a 3-dimensional motion. Is this statement true or false? 3. Projectile motion (at low speed) is uniformly accelerated motion. Is this statement true or false? 4. A particle is projected from ground with velocity 50 m/s at 37\u00b0 from horizontal. Find velocity and displacement after 2 s. sin 37 3 5 \u00b0 = . 5. A particle is projected from a tower of height 25 m with velocity 20 2 m/s at 45\u00b0. Find the time when particle strikes with ground. The horizontal distance from the foot of tower where it strikes. Also find the velocity at the time of collision. Note In question numbers 4 and 5, $i is in horizontal direction and $j is vertically upwards. 7.4 Time of Flight, Maximum Height and Horizontal Range of a Projectile Fig. 7.10 shows a particle projected from the point O with an initial velocity u at an angle \u03b1 with the horizontal. It goes through the highest point A and falls at B on the horizontal surface through O. The point O is called the point of projection, the angle\u03b1 is called the angle of projection, the distance OB is Chapter 7 Projectile Motion \u0097 221 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 7.1  called the horizontal range (R) or simply range and the vertical height AC is called the maximum height ( ) H . The total time taken by the particle in describing the path OAB is called the time of flight( ). T Time of Flight (T ) Refer Fig. 7.10. Here, x and y-axes are in the directions shown in figure. Axis x is along horizontal direction and axis y is vertically upwards. Thus, u u x = cos , \u03b1 u u a y x = = sin , \u03b1 0 and a g y = \u2212 At point B, sy = 0. So, applying s u t a t y y y = + 1 2 2,  we have 0 1 2 2 = \u2212 ( sin ) u t gt \u03b1 \u2234 t u g = 0 2 , sin \u03b1 Both t = 0 and t u g = 2 sin \u03b1 correspond to the situation where sy = 0.The time t = 0corresponds to point O and time t u g = 2 sin \u03b1 corresponds to point B. Thus, time of flight of the projectile is T tOAB = or T u g = 2 sin \u03b1 Maximum Height (H ) At point A vertical component of velocity becomes zero, i.e. v y = 0.

Hence, horizontal component of velocity u cos \u03b1 does not change during its motion. \u0098 Motion in vertical direction is first retarded then accelerated in opposite direction. Because uy is upwards and ay is downwards. Hence, vertical component of its velocity first decreases from O to A and then increases from A to B. This can be shown as in Fig. 7.13. \u0098 The coordinates and velocity components of the projectile at time t are x s u t u t x x = = = ( cos ) \u03b1 y s u t a t y y y = = + 1 2 2 = \u2212 ( sin ) u t gt \u03b1 1 2 2 v u u x x = = cos \u03b1 and v u a t u gt y y y = + = \u2212 sin \u03b1 Therefore, speed of projectile at time t is v v v x y = + 2 2 and the angle made by its velocity vector with positive x-axis is \u03b8 v v y x = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 tan 1 \u0098 Equation of trajectory of projectile x u t = ( cos ) \u03b1 \u2234 t x u = cos \u03b1 Substituting this value of t in, y u t gt = \u2212 ( sin ) \u03b1 1 2 2, we get y x gx u = \u2212 tan cos \u03b1 \u03b1 2 2 2 2 or y x gx u = \u2212 tan \u03b1 \u03b1 2 2 2 2 sec y x gx u = \u2212 + tan ( tan ) \u03b1 \u03b1 2 2 2 2 1 These are the standard equations of trajectory of a projectile. The equation is quadratic in x. This is why the path of a projectile is a parabola.

V Example 7.7 For given value of u, there are two angles of projection for which the horizontal range is the same. Show that the sum of the maximum heights for these two angles is independent of the angle of projection. Solution There are two angles of projection \u03b1 and 90\u00b0 \u2212\u03b1 for which the horizontal range R is same. Now, H u g 1 2 2 2 = sin \u03b1 and H u g 2 2 2 90 2 = \u00b0 \u2212 sin ( ) \u03b1 = u g 2 2 2 cos \u03b1 Therefore, H H u g 1 2 2 2 2 2 + = + (sin cos ) \u03b1 \u03b1 = u g 2 2 Clearly the sum of the heights for the two angles of projection is independent of the angles of projection.

One is up the plane and the other is down the plane. Let us discuss both the cases separately. Up the Plane In this case direction x is chosen up the plane and direction y is chosen perpendicular to the plane. Hence, u u x = \u2212 cos ( ) \u03b1 \u03b2 , a g x = \u2212 sin \u03b2 u u a g y y = \u2212 = \u2212 sin ( ) cos \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 and Now, let us derive the expressions for time of flight (T) and range (R) along the plane. Time of Flight At point B displacement along y-direction is zero. So, substituting the proper values in s u t a t y y y = + 1 2 2, we get 0 1 2 2 = \u2212 + \u2212 ut g t sin ( ) ( cos ) \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 \u21d2\u2234 t u g = \u2212 0 2 and sin ( ) cos \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 t = 0, corresponds to point O and t u g = \u2212 2 sin ( ) cos \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 corresponds to point B. Thus, T u g = \u2212 2 sin ( ) cos \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 Note Substituting \u03b2 = 0, in the above expression, we getT u g = 2 sin \u03b1 which is quite obvious because\u03b2 = 0 is the situation shown in Fig. 7.16.

V Example 7.9 A man standing on a hill top projects a stone horizontally with speed v0 as shown in figure. Taking the co-ordinate system as given in the figure. Find the co-ordinates of the point where the stone will hit the hill surface. Solution Range of the projectile on an inclined plane (down the plane) is, R u g = + + 2 2 2 cos [sin ( ) sin ] \u03b2 \u03b1 \u03b2 \u03b2 Here, u v = 0 , \u03b1 = 0 and \u03b2 \u03b8 = \u2234 R v g = 2 0 2 2 sin cos \u03b8 \u03b8 Now, x R v g = = cos tan \u03b8 \u03b8 2 0 2 and y R v g = \u2212 = \u2212 sin tan \u03b8 \u03b8 2 0 2 2 Chapter 7 Projectile Motion \u0097 229 v0 x y \u03b8 (0, 0) Fig. 7.18 \u03b2 \u03b1 u g sin \u03b2 g cos \u03b2 g x y \u03b2 O \u03b2 \u03b2 Fig. 7.17 v0 q R q Fig. 7.19  7.6 Relative Motion between Two Projectiles Let us now discuss the relative motion between two projectiles or the path observed by one projectile of the other. Suppose that two particles are projected from the ground with speeds u1 and u2 at angles \u03b11 and \u03b12 as shown in Fig. 7.20(a) and (b). Acceleration of both the particles is g downwards. So, relative acceleration between them is zero because a a a g g 12 1 2 0 = \u2212 = \u2212 = i.e. the relative motion between the two particles is uniform. Now, u u x 1 1 1 = cos , \u03b1 u u x 2 2 2 = cos \u03b1 u u u u y y 1 1 1 2 2 2 = = sin sin \u03b1 \u03b1 and Therefore, u u u u u x x x 12 1 2 1 1 2 2 = \u2212 = \u2212 cos cos \u03b1 \u03b1 and u u u u u y y y 12 1 2 1 1 2 2 = \u2212 = \u2212 sin sin \u03b1 \u03b1 u x 12 and u y 12 are the x and y components of relative velocity of 1 with respect to 2. Hence, relative motion of 1 with respect to 2 is a straight line at an angle \u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 \u2212 tan 1 12 12 u u y x with positive x-axis. Now, if u x 12 0 = or u u 1 1 2 2 cos cos \u03b1 \u03b1 = , the relative motion is along y-axis or in vertical direction (as \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 ). Similarly, if u y 12 0 = or u1 1 sin \u03b1 = u2 2 sin , \u03b1 the relative motion is along x-axis or in horizontal direction (as \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 ). Note Relative acceleration between two projectiles is zero. Relative motion between them is uniform. Therefore, condition of collision of two particles in air is that relative velocity of one with respect to the other should be along line joining them, i.e., if two projectiles A and B collide in mid air, then vAB should be along AB or vBA along BA. V Example 7.10 A particle A is projected with an initial velocity of 60 m/s at an angle 30\u00b0 to the horizontal. At the same time a second particle B is projected in opposite direction with initial speed of 50 m/s from a point at a distance of 100 m from A. If the particles collide in air, find (a) the angle of projection \u03b1 of particle B, (b) time when the collision takes place and (c) the distance of P from A, where collision occurs.

Hence, the relative motion between the two is uniform. It can be assumed that B is at rest and A is moving with u AB . Hence, the two particles will collide, if u AB is along AB. This is possible only when u u Ay By = i.e. component of relative velocity along y-axis should be zero. or 30 50 = sin \u03b1 \u2234 \u03b1 = = \u00b0 \u2212 sin ( / ) 1 3 5 37 Ans.

In projectile motion speed (and hence kinetic energy) is minimum at highest point. Speed = (cos ) \u03b8 times the speed of projection and kinetic energy = (cos ) 2 \u03b8 times the initial kinetic energy Here, \u03b8 =angle of projection 2. In projectile motion it is sometimes better to write the equations ofH R , andT in terms ofux and uy as T u g y = 2 , H u g y = 2 2 and R u u g x y = 2 3. If a particle is projected vertically upwards, then during upward journey gravity forces (weight) and air drag both are acting downwards. Hence, |retardation| > |g|. During its downward journey air drag is upwards while gravity is downwards. Hence, acceleration < g.. Therefore we may conclude that, time of ascent < time of descent Exercise : In projectile motion, if air drag is taken into consideration than state whether theH R , and T will increase, decrease or remain same.

Type 4. Based on trajectory of a projectile Concept We have seen that equation of trajectory of projectile is y x gx u = tan cos \u03b8 \u2212 \u03b8 2 2 2 2 = \u2212 + x gx u tan ( tan ) \u03b8 \u03b8 2 2 2 2 1 In some problems, the given equation of a projectile is compared with this standard equation to find the unknowns.

The equation of motion of the particle has the form y px qx = \u2212 2 where p and q are positive constants. Find the velocity of the particle at the origin of co-ordinates. Solution Comparing the given equation with the equation of a projectile motion, y x gx u = \u2212 + tan ( tan ) \u03b8 \u03b8 2 2 2 2 1 We find that g a = , tan \u03b8 = p and a u q 2 1 2 2 ( tan ) + = \u03b8 \u2234 u = velocity of particle at origin = + = + a q a p q ( tan ) ( ) 1 2 1 2 2 2 \u03b8 238 \u0097 Mechanics - I 30 m/s v 40 m/s \u03b8 O P Q 45 m Tower 40 m/s  Type 5. Based on basic concepts of projectile motion. Concept Following are given some basic concepts of any projectile motion : (i) Horizontal component of velocity always remains constant. (ii) Vertical component of velocity changes by 10 m/s or 9.8 m/s in every second in downward direction. For example, if vertical component of velocity at t = 0 is 30 m/s then change in vertical component in first five seconds is as given in following table: Time (in sec) Vertical component (in m/s) Direction 0 30 upwards 1 20 upwards 2 10 upwards 3 0 - 4 10 downwards 5 20 downwards In general we can use, v u a t y y y = + (iii) At a height difference \u2018h\u2019 between two points 1 and 2, the vertical components v1 and v2 are related as, v v gh 2 1 2 2 = \u00b1 \u00b1 In moving upwards, vertical component decreases. So, take \u22122gh in the above equation if  point 2 is higher than point 1. (iv) Horizontal displacement is simply, s u t x x = (in the direction of ux ) (v) Vertical displacement has two components (say s1 and s2), one due to initial velocity u y and the other due to gravity. s u t y 1 = = displacement due to initial component of velocity u y. This s1 is in the direction of u y (upwards or downwards) s gt 2 2 1 2 = = 5 2 t (if g=10 2 m/s ) This s2 is always downwards. Net vertical displacement is the resultant of s1 and s2.

Field Forces These are the forces in which contact between two objects is not necessary. Gravitational force between two bodies and electrostatic force between two charges are two examples of field forces. Weight ( ) w mg = of a body comes in this category. Contact Forces Two bodies in contact exert equal and opposite forces on each other. If the contact is frictionless, the contact force is perpendicular to the common surface and known as normal reaction. If, however the objects are in rough contact and move (or have a tendency to move) relative to each other without losing contact then frictional force arise which oppose such motion. Again each object exerts a frictional force on the other and the two forces are equal and opposite. This force is perpendicular to normal reaction. Thus, the contact force ( ) F between two objects is made up of two forces. (i) Normal reaction ( ) N (ii) Force of friction ( ) f and since these two forces are mutually perpendicular. F N f = + 2 2 Note In this book normal reaction at most of the places has been represented by N. But at some places, it is also represented by R. This is because N is confused with the SI unit of force newton. Consider two wooden blocks A and B being rubbed against each other. In Fig. 8.1, A is being moved to the right while B is being moved leftward. In order to see more clearly which forces act on A and which on B, a second diagram is drawn showing a space between the blocks but they are still supposed to be in contact. In Fig. 8.2, the two normal reactions each of magnitude N are perpendicular to the surface of contact between the blocks and the two frictional forces each of magnitude f act along that surface, each in a direction opposing the motion of the block upon which it acts. Note Forces on block B from the ground are not shown in the figure. ",

Regarding the tension and string, the following three points are important to remember: 1. If a string is inextensible the magnitude of acceleration of any number of masses connected through the string is always same. 2. If a string is massless, the tension in it is same everywhere. However, if a string has a mass and it is accelerated, tension at different points will be different. 3. If pulley is massless and frictionless, tension will be same on both sides of the pulley. Spring force ( ) F kx = has been discussed in detail in the chapter of work, energy and power. Hinge Force In the figure shown there is a hinge force on the rod (from the hinge).

Such forces (and the object) are said to be in equilibrium. For understanding the equilibrium of an object under two or more concurrent or coplanar forces let us first discuss the resolution of force and moment of a force about some point. Resolution of a Force When a force is replaced by an equivalent set of components, it is said to be resolved. One of the most useful ways in which to resolve a force is to choose only two components (although a force may be resolved in three or more components also) which are at right angles also. The magnitude of these components can be very easily found using trigonometry. In Fig. 8.17, F F 1 = = cos \u03b8 component of F along AC F F 2 = = sin \u03b8 component of F perpendicular to AC ",

Similarly, the component of a force in a direction parallel to the force is equal to the magnitude of the force. For example component of the above force in the direction of force (horizontal) will be 10 N.

The magnitude of torque, also known as the moment of a force F is calculated by multiplying together the magnitude of the force and its perpendicular distance r\u22a5from the axis of rotation. This is denoted by C or \u03c4 (tau). i.e. C Fr = \u22a5 or \u03c4 = \u22a5 Fr Direction of Torque The angular direction of a torque is the sense of the rotation it would cause. Consider a lamina that is free to rotate in its own plane about an axis perpendicular to the lamina and passing through a point A on the lamina. In the diagram the moment about the axis of rotation of the force F1 is F r 1 1 anticlock-wise and the moment of the force F2 is F r 2 2 clockwise. A convenient way to differentiate between clockwise and anticlock-wise torques is to allocate a positive sign to one sense (usually, but not invariably, this is anticlockwise) and negative sign to the other. With this convention, the moments of F1 and F2 are + F r 1 1 and \u2212F r 2 2 (when using a sign convention in any problem it is advisable to specify the chosen positive sense). 268 \u0097 Mechanics - I O X Y Fig. 8.22 O X ' Y ' Fig. 8.24 30\u00b0 w cos 30\u00b0 w sin 30\u00b0 w f N 30\u00b0 T sin 30\u00b0 T cos 30\u00b0 T Fig. 8.23 ",

(ii) no rotation about any axis. The set of forces must, therefore, be such that (a) the algebraic sum of the components parallel to OX is zero or \u03a3Fx = 0 (b) the algebraic sum of the components parallel to OY is zero or \u03a3Fy = 0 (c) the resultant moment about any specified axis is zero or \u03a3\u03c4 any axis = 0 Thus, for the equilibrium of a set of two or more coplanar forces \u03a3Fx = 0 \u03a3Fy = 0 and \u03a3\u03c4 any axis = 0 Using the above three conditions, we get only three set of equations.

Law I Every body continues in its state of rest or in uniform motion in a straight line unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed upon it. Law II The change of motion is proportional to the magnitude of force impressed and is made in the direction of the straight line in which that force is impressed. Law III To every action there is always an equal and opposite reaction or the mutual actions of two bodies upon each other are always directed to contrary parts. The modern versions of these laws are: 1. A body continues in its initial state of rest or motion with uniform velocity unless acted on by an unbalanced external force. 2. The acceleration of a body is inversely proportional of its mass and directly proportional to the resultant external force acting on it, i.e. \u03a3F F a = = net m or a F = net m 3. Forces always occur in pairs. If body A exerts a force on body B, an equal but opposite force is exerted by body B on body A. Working with Newton\u2019s First and Second Laws Normally any problem relating to Newton\u2019s laws is solved in following four steps: 1. First of all we decide the system on which the laws of motion are to be applied. The system may be a single particle, a block or a combination of two or more blocks, two blocks connected by a string, etc. The only restriction is that all parts of the system should have the same acceleration. 2. Once the system is decided, we make the list of all the forces acting on the system. Any force applied by the system on other bodies is not included in the list of the forces. 3. Then we make a free body diagram of the system and indicate the magnitude and directions of all the forces listed in step 2 in this diagram. 4. In the last step we choose any two mutually perpendicular axes say x and y in the plane of the forces in case of coplanar forces. Choose the x-axis along the direction in which the system is known to have or is likely to have the acceleration. A direction perpendicular to it may be chosen as the y-axis. If the system is in equilibrium any mutually perpendicular directions may be chosen. Write the components of all the forces along the x-axis and equate their sum to the product of the mass of  the system and its acceleration, i.e. \u03a3F ma x = \u2026(i) This gives us one equation. Now, we write the components of the forces along the y-axis and equate the sum to zero. This gives us another equation, i.e. \u03a3Fy = 0 \u2026(ii) Note (i) If the system is in equilibrium we will write the two equations as \u03a3Fx = 0 and \u03a3Fy = 0 (ii) If the forces are collinear, the second equation, i.e. \u03a3Fy = 0 is not needed. 276 \u0097 Mechanics - I  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 Ifa is the acceleration of a body, then ma force does not act on the body but this much force is required to providea acceleration to the body. The different available forces acting on the body provide this ma force or, we can say that vector sum of all forces acting on the body is equal to ma. The available forces may be weight, tension, normal reaction, friction or any externally applied force etc. \u0098 If all bodies of a system has a common acceleration then that common acceleration can be given by a = Net pulling/pusing force Total mass = NPF ",

For example weight ( ) mg or some applied force F. Tension makes an equal and opposite pair. So, they are not to be included, unless the system in broken at some place and only one tension is considered on the system under consideration. \u0098 After finding that common acceleration, we will have to draw free body diagrams of different blocks to find normal reaction or tension etc. V Example 8.13 Two blocks of masses 4 kg and 2 kg are placed side by side on a smooth horizontal surface as shown in the figure. A horizontal force of 20 N is applied on 4 kg block. Find (a) the acceleration of each block. (b) the normal reaction between two blocks. Solution (a) Both the blocks will move with same acceleration (say a) in horizontal direction. Let us take both the blocks as a system. Net external force on the system is 20 N in horizontal direction. Using \u03a3F ma x x = 20 4 2 6 = + = ( )a a or a = 10 3 m /s 2 Ans.

Using \u03a3F ma x x = For 4 kg block, 20 4 4 10 3 \u2212 = = \u00d7 N a N = \u2212 = 20 40 3 20 3 newton Ans. This can also be solved as under For 2 kg block, N a = = \u00d7 = 2 2 10 3 20 3 newton Here, N is the normal reaction between the two blocks. Note In free body diagram of the blocks we have not shown the forces acting on the blocks in vertical direction, because normal reaction between the blocks and acceleration of the system can be obtained without using \u03a3Fy = 0. V Example 8.14 Three blocks of masses 3 kg, 2 kg and 1 kg are placed side by side on a smooth surface as shown in figure. A horizontal force of 12 N is applied on 3 kg block. Find the net force on 2 kg block. Solution Since, all the blocks will move with same acceleration (say a) in horizontal direction. Let us take all the blocks as a single system. Net external force on the system is 12 N in horizontal direction. Using \u03a3F ma x x = , we get, 12 3 2 1 6 = + + = ( )a a or a = = 12 6 2 2 m/s 278 \u0097 Mechanics - I x y 20 N N a a 2kg 4kg Fig. 8.53 a 12 N 2kg 3kg 1kg x y Fig. 8.55 12N 2kg 3kg 1kg Fig. 8.54  Alternate Method a = Net pushing force Total mass = + + = 12 3 2 1 2 2 m/s Now, let F be the net force on 2 kg block in x-direction, then using \u03a3F ma x x = for 2 kg block, we get F = = ( )( ) 2 2 4 N Ans. Note Here, net force F on 2 kg block is the resultant of N1 and N N N 2 1 2 ( ) > where, N1 = normal reaction between 3 kg and 2 kg block, and N2 = normal reaction between 2 kg and 1 kg block. Thus, F N N = \u2212 1 2 V Example 8.15 In the arrangement shown in figure. The strings are light and inextensible. The surface over which blocks are placed is smooth. Find (a) the acceleration of each block, (b) the tension in each string. Solution (a) Let a be the accelera- tion of each block and T1 and T2 be the tensions, in the two strings as shown in figure. Taking the three blocks and the two strings as the system. Using \u03a3F ma x x = or 14 4 2 1 = + + ( )a or a = = 14 7 2 m/s 2 Ans. Alternate Method a = Net pulling force Total mass = + + = 14 4 2 1 2 2 m/s (b) Free body diagram (showing the forces in x-direction only) of 4 kg block and 1kg block are shown in Fig. 8.59.

        "content": "F Fig. 8.80  8.5 Constraint Equations In the above article, we have discussed the cases where different blocks of the system had a common acceleration and that common acceleration was given by a = Net pulling / pushing force Total mass Now, the question is, if different blocks have different accelerations then what? In those cases, we take help of constraint equations. These equations establish the relation between accelerations (or velocities) of different blocks of a system. Depending upon different kinds of problems we have divided the constraint equations in following two types. Most of them are directly explained with the help of some example (s) in their support. Type 1 V Example 8.20 Using constraint method find the relation between accelerations of 1 and 2. Solution At any instant of time let x1 and x2 be the displacements of 1 and 2 from a fixed line (shown dotted). Here x1 and x2 are variables but, x x 1 2 + = constant or x x l 1 2 + = (length of string) Differentiating with respect to time, we have v v 1 2 0 + = or v v 1 2 = \u2212 Again differentiating with respect to time, we get a a 1 2 0 + = or a a 1 2 = \u2212 This is the required relation between a1 and a2, i.e. accelerations of  1 and 2 are equal but in opposite directions. Note (i) In the equation x x l 1 2 + = , we have neglected the length of string over the pulley. But that length is also constant. (ii) In constraint equation if we get a a 1 2 = \u2212 , then negative sign does not always represent opposite directions of a1 and a2. The real significance of this sign is, x2 decreases if x1 increases and vice-versa. Chapter 8 Laws of Motion \u0097 285 1 2 1 x1 2 1 x2 Fig. 8.81 Fig. 8.82  V Example 8.21 Using constraint equations find the relation between a1 and a2. Solution In Fig. 8.84, points 1, 2, 3 and 4 are movable. Let their displacements from a fixed dotted line be x x x 1 2 3 , , and x4 x x l 1 3 1 + = ( ) ( ) x x x x l 1 3 4 3 2 \u2212 + \u2212 = ( ) ( ) x x x x l 1 4 2 4 3 \u2212 + \u2212 = On double differentiating with respect to time, we will get following three constraint relations a a 1 3 0 + = \u2026(i) a a a 1 4 3 2 0 + \u2212 = \u2026(ii) a a a 1 2 4 2 0 + \u2212 = \u2026(iii) Solving Eqs. (i), (ii) and (iii),  we get a a 2 1 7 = \u2212 Which is the desired relation between a1 and a2. V Example 8.22 In the above example, if two blocks have masses 1 kg and 2 kg respectively then find their accelerations and tensions in different strings. Solution Pulleys 3 and 4 are massless. Hence net force on them should be zero. Therefore, if we take T tension in the shortest string, then tension in other two strings will be 2T and 4T. 286 \u0097 Mechanics - I x3 x4 x2 x1 3 4 2 Fig. 8.84 1 2 1 Fig. 8.83 4T 2T T W1=10 N T W2 = 20 N 7a 1 2 4T 2T T 2T 4T T a 7a 1 kg 2 kg Fig. 8.85  Further, if a is the acceleration of 1 in upward direction, then from the constraint equation a a 2 1 7 = \u2212 , acceleration of 2 will be 7a downwards. Writing the equation, F ma net = for the two blocks we have 4 2 10 1 T T T a + + \u2212 = \u00d7 or 7 10 T a \u2212 = \u2026(i) 20 2 7 \u2212 = \u00d7 T a ( ) or 20 14 \u2212 = T a \u2026(ii) Solving these two equations we get, T =1.62 N Ans. and a =1.31m/s 2 Ans. Note In a problem if \u2018a\u2019 comes out to be negative after calculations then we will change the initially assumed directions of accelerations. Type 2 V Example 8.23 The system shown in figure is released from rest. Find acceleration of different blocks and tension in different strings. Solution Chapter 8 Laws of Motion \u0097 287 1 kg 2 kg 3 kg Fig. 8.86 1 kg 2 kg 3 kg 2T 2T T T P a a ar Net acceleration = a \u2013 a r ar Net acceleration = a + ar Fig. 8.87  (i) Pulley P and 1 kg mass are attached with the same string. Therefore, if 1 kg mass has an acceleration \u2018a\u2019 in upward direction, then pulley P will have an acceleration \u2018a\u2019 downwards. (ii) 2 kg and 3 kg blocks are attached with the same string passing over a moveable pulley P. Therefore their relative acceleration, ar (relative to pulley) will be same. Their net accelerations (relative to ground) are as shown in figure. (iii) Pulley P is massless. Hence net force on this pulley should be zero. If T is the tension in the string connecting 2 kg and 3 kg mass, then tension in the upper string will be 2T. Now writing the equation, F ma net = for three blocks, we have: 1 kg block: 2 10 1 T a \u2212 = \u00d7 \u2026(i) 2 kg block: T a a r \u2212 = \u2212 20 2( ) \u2026(ii) 3 kg block: 30 3 \u2212 = + T a a r ( ) \u2026(iii) Solving Eqs. (i), (ii) and (iii) we get, T = 828 . N, a = 6.55 m/s 2 and ar = 0.7 m/s 2. Now, acceleration of 3kg block is ( ) a ar + or 725 . m/ s 2 downwards and acceleration of 2kg is ( ) a a r \u2212 or \u2212585 . m/ s 2 upwards. Since, this comes out to be negative, hence acceleration of 2 kg block is 585 . m/ s 2 downwards. 288 \u0097 Mechanics - I 2T 1 kg w1 = 10 N a Fig. 8.88 T 2 kg w2 = 20 N a \u2013 a r Fig. 8.89 T 3 kg w3 = 30 N a + a r Fig. 8.90  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 In some cases, acceleration of a block is inversely proportional to tension force acting on the block (or its component in the direction of motion or acceleration).If tension is double (as compared to other block), then acceleration will be half. In Fig. (a): Tension force on block-1 is double ( ) =2T than the tension force on block-2 ( ) =T . Therefore, acceleration of block -1 will be half. If block-1 has an acceleration \u2018a' in downward direction, then block -2 will have an acceleration \u20182a\u2019 towards right. In Fig. (b): Tension force on block-1 is three times ( ) 2 3 T T T + = than the tension force on block-2 ( ) =T . Therefore acceleration of block-2 will be three times. If block-1 has an acceleration \u2018a\u2019 in upwards direction, then acceleration of block-2 will be \u20183a\u2019 downwards. 1. Make the constraint relation betweena a 1 2 , and a3. 2.

Frame of reference is the way of observation the things. Inertial Frame of Reference A non-accelerating frame of reference is called an inertial frame of reference. A frame of reference moving with a constant velocity is an inertial frame of reference. Non-inertial Frame of Reference An accelerating frame of reference is called a non-inertial frame of reference. Note (i) A rotating frame of reference is a non-inertial frame of reference, because it is also an accelerating one. (ii) Earth is rotating about its axis of rotation and it is revolving around the centre of sun also. So, it is non-intertial frame of reference. But for most of the cases, we consider its as an inertial frame of reference. Now let us come to the pseudo force. Instead of ground (or inertial frame of reference) when we start watching the objects from a non-inertial (accelerating) frame of reference its motion conditions are felt differently. For example Suppose a child is standing inside an accelerating lift. From ground frame of reference this child appears to be accelerating but from lift (non-inertial) frame of reference child appears to be at rest. To justify this changed condition of motion, from equations point of view we have to apply a pseudo force. This pseudo force is given by F a p m = \u2212 Here, \u2018m\u2019 is the mass of that body/object which is being observed from non-inertial frame of reference and a is the acceleration of frame of reference. Negative sign implies that direction of pseudo force Fp is opposite to a. Hence whenever you make free body diagram of a body from a non-inertial frame, apply all real forces (actually acting) on the body plus one pseudo force. Magnitude of this pseudo force is \u2018ma\u2019 and the direction is opposite to a. Example Suppose a block A of mass m is placed on a lift ascending with an acceleration a0.

Problems of non-intertial frames can be solved only with the concept of pseudo force. Is this statement true or false? 8.7 Friction Regarding the frictional force (f ) following points are worthnoting : 1. It is the tangential component of net contact force (F) acting between two bodies in contact. 2. It starts acting when there is tendency of relative motion (different velocities) between two bodies in contact or actual relative motion takes place. So, friction has a tendency to stop relative motion between two bodies in contact. 3. If there is only tendency of relative motion then static friction acts and if actual relative motion takes place, then kinetic friction acts. 294 \u0097 Mechanics - I INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 8.4 \u03b8 T mg T sin \u03b8 T cos \u03b8 mg F ma P = ma Fig. 8.108  4. Like any other force of nature friction force also makes a pair of equal and opposite forces acting on two different bodies. 5. Direction of friction force on a given body is opposite to the direction of relative motion (or its tendency) of this body. 6. In Fig. (i), motion of block A means its relative motion with respect to ground. So, in this case friction between block and ground has a tendency to stop its motion. In Fig. (ii), relative motion between two blocks B and C means their different velocities. So, friction between these two blocks has a tendency to make their velocities same. 7. Static friction is self adjusting in nature. This varies from zero to a limiting value f L . Only that much amount of friction will act which can stop the relative motion. 8. Kinetic friction is constant and it can be denoted by f k . 9. It is found experimentally that limiting value of static friction f L and constant value of kinetic friction f k both are directly proportional to normal reaction N acting between the two bodies. \u2234 f L or f N k \u221d \u21d2 f N L s =\u00b5 and f N k k =\u00b5 Here, \u00b5 s= coefficient of static friction and \u00b5 k = coefficient of kinetic friction. Both \u00b5 s and \u00b5 k are dimensionless constants which depend on the nature of surfaces in contact. Value of\u00b5 k is usually less than the value of\u00b5 s i.e. constant value of kinetic friction is less than the limiting value of static friction. Note (i) In problems, if \u00b5s and \u00b5k are not given separately but only \u00b5 is given. Then use f f N L k = = \u00b5 (ii) If more than two blocks are placed one over the other on a horizontal ground then normal reaction between two blocks will be equal to the weight of the blocks over the common surface. For example, N1 = normal reaction between A and B = m g A N2 = normal reaction between B and C = + ( ) m m g A B and so on. Chapter 8 Laws of Motion \u0097 295 A B C D Fig. 8.110 B C A (i) (ii) Fig. 8.109  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 Friction force is electromagnetic in nature. The surfaces in contact, however smooth they may appear, actually have imperfections called asperities. When one surface rests on the other the actual area of contact is very less than the surface area of the face of contact. The pressure due to the reaction force between the surfaces is very high as the true contact area is very small. Hence, these contact points deform a little and cold welds are formed at these points. So, in order to start the relative sliding between these surfaces, enough force has to be applied to break these welds. But, once the welds break and the surfaces start sliding over each other, the further formation of these welds is relatively slow and weak and hence a smaller force is enough to keep the block moving with uniform velocity. This is the reason why limiting value of static friction is greater than the kinetic friction. Note By making the surfaces extra smooth, frictional force increases as actual area of contact increases and the two bodies in contact act like a single body. V Example 8.26 Suppose a block of mass 1 kg is placed over a rough surface and a horizontal force F is applied on the block as shown in figure. Now, let us see what are the values of force of friction f and acceleration of the block a if the force F is gradually increased. Given that \u00b5 s = 0.5, \u00b5 k = 0.4 and g m s = 10 2 / . Solution Free body diagram of the block is \u03a3Fy = 0 \u2234 N mg \u2212 = 0 or N mg = = = ( )( ) 1 10 10 N f N L s = = = \u00b5 ( )( ) 0.5 N 10 5 and f N k k = = = \u00b5 ( . )( ) 04 10 4 N 296 \u0097 Mechanics - I F Fig. 8.112 F a x y f mg N Fig. 8.113 Actual contact area Fig. 8.111  Below is explained in tabular form, how the force of friction f depends on the applied force F.

Therefore, slope of line OA will be 1 ( ) y mx = or angle of line OA with F-axis is 45\u00b0. Here, a = 0 for F \u22645 N and a F f m F F K = \u2212 = \u2212 = \u2212 4 1 4 for F > 5 N a-F graph is as shown in Fig. 8.115. When F is slightly increased from 5 N, acceleration of block increases from 0 to 1 m/s 2. Think why? Note Henceforth, we will take coefficient of friction as \u00b5 unless and until specially mentioned in the question \u00b5s and \u00b5k separately.

The resultant of these two forces is F and it makes an angle \u03bb with the normal reaction, where tan \u03bb \u00b5 \u00b5 = = N N or \u03bb \u00b5 = \u2212 tan ( ) 1 \u2026(i) This angle \u03bb is called the angle of friction. Angle of Repose (\u03b1) Suppose a block of mass m is placed on an inclined plane whose inclination \u03b8 can be increased or decreased. Let,\u00b5 be the coefficient of friction between the block and the plane. At a general angle\u03b8, Normal reaction N mg = cos \u03b8 Limiting friction f N mg L = = \u00b5 \u00b5 \u03b8 cos and the driving force (or pulling force) F mg = sin \u03b8 (Down the plane) From these three equations we see that, when \u03b8 is increased from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0, normal reaction N and hence, the limiting friction f L is decreased while the driving force F is increased. There is a critical angle called angle of repose ( ) \u03b1 at which these two forces are equal. Now, if \u03b8 is further increased, then the driving force F becomes more than the limiting friction f L and the block starts sliding. Thus, f F L = at \u03b8 \u03b1 = or \u00b5 \u03b1 \u03b1 mg mg cos sin = or tan \u03b1 \u00b5 = or \u03b1 \u00b5 = \u2212 tan ( ) 1 \u2026(ii) From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we see that angle of friction ( ) \u03bb is numerically equal to the angle of repose. or \u03bb \u03b1 = From the above discussion we can conclude that If \u03b8 \u03b1 < , F f L < the block is stationary. If \u03b8 \u03b1 = , F f L = the block is on the verge of sliding. and if \u03b8 \u03b1 > , F f L > the block slides down with acceleration a F f m g L = \u2212 = \u2212 (sin cos ) \u03b8 \u00b5 \u03b8 298 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u03bb \u00b5N N F Fig. 8.116 m \u03b8 Fig. 8.117  Variation of N f L , and F with \u03b8, is shown graphically in Fig. 8.118.

Solution Since, the block is permanently at rest, it is in equilibrium. Net force on it should be zero. In this case, only two forces are acting on the block (1) Weight = mg (downwards). (2) Contact force (resultant of normal reaction and friction force) applied by the wedge on the block. For the block to be in equilibrium, these two forces should be equal and opposite. Therefore, force exerted by the wedge on the block is mg (upwards). Note (i) From Newton\u2019s third law of motion, force exerted by the block on the wedge is also mg but downwards. (ii) This result can also be obtained in a different manner.

Feeling of weight to a person is due to the normal reaction. Under normal conditions, N mg = . Therefore feeling of weight is the actual weight mg. If we are standing on a lift and the lift has an acceleration \u2018a\u2019 upwards thenN m g a = + ( ). Therefore feeling of weight is more than the actual weight mg. Similarly if \u2018a\u2019 is downwards thenN m g a = \u2212 ( ) and feeling of weight is less than the actual weight mg. 3. If \u00b5 \u00b5 \u00b5 s N = = then, limiting value of static friction = constant value of kinetic friction = \u00b5N. Here, N mg = on horizontal ground or N mg = cos \u03b8 on inclined ground as long as the external forces (other than weight and normal reaction) are either zero or tangential to the surface. If the external force is inclined to the horizontal surface (or inclined plane), then normal reaction either increase or decrease depending on the direction of F.

Resolution of forces Concept Different situations of this type can be classified in following two types: (i) Permanent rest, body in equilibrium, net force equal to zero, net acceleration equal to zero or moving with constant velocity. (ii) Accelerated and temporary rest. How to Solve? l In the first situation, forces can be resolved in any direction. Net force (or summation of components of different forces acting on the body) in any direction should be zero. l In the second situation forces are normally resolved along acceleration and perpendicular to it. In a direction perpendicular to acceleration net force is zero and along acceleration net force is ma. l In temporary rest situation velocity of the body is zero but acceleration is not zero. The direction of acceleration in this case is the direction in which the body is supposed to move just after few seconds. Three situations of temporary rest are shown below. Note In the second situation also, we can resolve the forces in any direction. In that case, net force along this direction = (mass) (component of acceleration in this direction) V Example 1 A ball of mass 1 kg is at rest in position P by means of two light strings OP and RP. The string RP is now cut and the ball swings to position Q. If \u03b8 = \u00b0 45 . Find the tensions in the strings in positions OP (when RP was not cut) and OQ (when RP was cut).

Another horizontal force of 10 N is applied on the block in a direction parallel to the wall. Will the block move? If yes, in which direction? If no, find the frictional force exerted by the wall on the block. ( g m s = 10 2 / ) Solution Normal reaction on the block from the wall will be ( Fnet = 0, perpendicular to the wall) R F = = 20 N Therefore, limiting friction f R L = \u00b5 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 4 20 ( ) = 5 N Weight of the block is w mg = = = ( )( ) 1 10 10 N A horizontal force of 10 N is applied to the block. Both weight and this force are along the wall. The resultant of these two forces will be 10 2 N in the direction shown in figure. Since, this resultant is greater than the limiting friction. The block will move in the direction of Fnet with acceleration a f m L = \u2212 = \u2212 = Fnet 9.14 m/s 10 2 5 1 2 Type 6. To draw acceleration versus time graph.

Limiting value of friction, f R 1 06 20 12 = = \u00d7 = \u00b5 . N The applied force F t ( ) =2 crosses this limiting value of friction at 6s. Therefore, upto 6 s block remains stationary and after 6s it starts moving. After 6 s, friction becomes constant at 12 N but the applied force keeps on increasing. Therefore, acceleration keeps on increasing.

N \u00b5kR = \u00d7 = 04 20 8 . N Upto 6 s, situation is same but after 6 s, a constant kinetic friction of 8N will act. At 6 s, friction will suddenly change from 12 N ( ) =\u00b5sR to 8N ( ) =\u00b5kR and direction of friction is opposite to its motion. Therefore, at 6 s it will start with an initial acceleration. ai = = \u2212 = decrease in friction mass m/s 12 8 2 2 2 For t \u22646 s f F t = =2 \u2026(i) F F f net = \u2212 =0 \u2234 a F m = = net 0 For t \u22656 s F t =2 f R k = = \u00b5 8N F F f t net = \u2212 = \u2212 2 8 \u2234 a F m t t = = \u2212 = \u2212 net 2 8 2 4 ( ) At t =6 s, we can see that, ai =2 2 m/s Further, a t - graph is a straight line of slope = 1 and intercept = \u22124.

A time varying horizontal force F t = 2 is applied on the upper block as shown in figure. Here t is in second and F is in newton. Draw a graph showing accelerations of A and B on y-axis and time on x-axis. Coefficient of friction between A and B is \u00b5 = 1 2 and the horizontal surface over which B is placed is smooth. ( ) g m s = 10 2 / Concept In the given example, block A will move due to the applied force but block B moves due to friction (between A and B). But there is a limiting value of friction between them. Therefore, there is a limiting value of acceleration (of block B). Up to this acceleration they move as a single block with a common acceleration, but after that acceleration of B will become constant (as friction acting on this block will become constant). But acceleration of A will keep on increasing as a time increasing force is acting on it. Solution Limiting friction between A and B is f m g L A = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \u00b5 1 2 2 10 10 ( ) ( ) N Block B moves due to friction only. Therefore, maximum acceleration of B can be a f m L B max = = = 10 4 2 2.5 m/s Thus, both the blocks move together with same acceleration till the common acceleration becomes 25 2 . m/s , after that acceleration of B will become constant while that of A will go on increasing. To find the time when the acceleration of both the blocks becomes 25 2 . m/s (or when slipping will start between A and B) we will write 2.5 = + = F m m t A B ( ) 2 6 \u2234 t = 7.5 s Hence, for t \u22647.5 s a a F m m t t A B A B = = + = = 2 6 3 Thus, aA versus t or aB versus t graph is a straight line passing through origin of slope 1 3 . For, t \u22657.5 s aB = = 2.5 m/s constant 2 and a F f m A L A = \u2212 or a t A = \u2212 2 10 2 or a t A = \u22125 Chapter 8 Laws of Motion \u0097 313 A B F t = 2 A F t = 2 fL = 10 N B fL = 10 N For 7.5 s t \u2265  Thus, aA versus t graph is a straight line of slope 1 and intercept \u20135. While aB versus t graph is a straight line parallel to t-axis. The corresponding graph is as shown in above figure. Type 7. When two blocks in contact are given different velocities and after some time, due to friction their velocities become equal. Concept In the figure shown, if v v 1 2 > (or v v 1 2 \u2260 ) then there is a relative motion between the two blocks. As v v 1 2 > , relative motion of A is towards right and relation motion of B is towards left. Since, relative motion is there, so kinetic friction (or limiting value of friction) will act in the opposite direction of relative motion. This friction (and acceleration due to this force) with decrease the velocity of A and increase the velocity of B. After some time when their velocities become equal, frictional force between them becomes zero and they continue to be moving with that common velocity (as the ground is smooth). How to Solve? l Find value of kinetic friction or limiting value of friction ( ) f N N k =\u00b5 \u00b5 or between the two blocks and then accelerations of these blocks = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 f m .

Type 8. Acceleration or retardation of a car Concept A car accelerates or retards due to friction. On a horizontal road maximum available friction is \u00b5N or \u00b5 mg (as N mg = ). Therefore, maximum acceleration or retardation of a car on a horizontal road is a f m mg m g max max = = = \u00b5 \u00b5 On an inclined plane maximum value of friction is \u00b5N or \u00b5 \u03b8 mgcos (as N mg = cos\u03b8). Now mgsin\u03b8 is a force which is always downwards but the frictional force varying from 0 to \u00b5 \u03b8 mgcos can be applied in upward or downward direction by the application of brakes or accelerator.

Then, 1 2 1 2 400 2 2 at at + = m or at2 400 = m or 4 400 2 t = or t =10 s Therefore, the minimum time is 20 s (10 s of acceleration and 10 s of retardation). Ans. V Example 15 A car is moving up the plane. Angle of inclination is \u03b8 and coefficient of friction is \u00b5. (a) What is the condition in which car can be accelerated? If this condition is satisfied then find (b) maximum acceleration of the car. (c) minimum retardation of the car. (d) maximum retardation of the car. Solution (a) mgsin\u03b8 in all conditions is downwards but direction of friction may be upwards or downwards. We will have to press accelerator for upward friction and brakes for downward friction. To accelerate the car friction should be upwards. Therefore, car can be accelerated if maximum upward friction >mgsin\u03b8 or \u00b5 \u03b8 \u03b8 mg mg cos sin > or \u00b5 \u03b8 > tan (b) Maximum acceleration = maximum upwards force mass = \u2212 = \u2212 \u00b5 \u03b8 \u03b8 \u00b5 \u03b8 \u03b8 mg mg m g g cos sin ( cos sin ) (c) Minimum retardation will be zero, when upward friction = mgsin\u03b8 (d) Maximum retardation = maximum downward force m = + mg mg m sin cos \u03b8 \u00b5 \u03b8 = + ( sin cos g g \u03b8 \u00b5 \u03b8) This is the case, when maximum friction force acts in downward direction. 316 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u03b8 v mg sin \u03b8  V Example 16 In the adjoining figure, angle of plane \u03b8 is increased from 0\u00b0 to 90\u00b0.

Find the acceleration of 2.0 kg block. ( / g m s = 10 2 ). Solution Since, \u00b5 \u00b5 1 2 < , acceleration of 2 kg block down the plane will be more than the acceleration of 4 kg block, if allowed to move separately.

Both the blocks are resting on a horizontal floor and the pulley is held such that string remains just taut.At moment t = 0, a force F t = 20 newton starts acting on the pulley along vertically upward direction as shown in figure. Calculate (a) velocity of A when B loses contact with the floor. (b) height raised by the pulley upto that instant. (Take, g = 10 m s / 2) Solution (a) Let T be the tension in the string. Then, 2 20 T t = or T t = 10 newton Let the block A loses its contact with the floor at time t t = 1. This happens when the tension in string becomes equal to the weight of A. Thus, T mg = or 10 1 10 1t = \u00d7 or t1 1 = s \u2026(i) Similarly, for block B, we have 10 2 10 2t = \u00d7 or t2 2 = s \u2026(ii) i.e. the block B loses contact at 2 s.

V Example 22 Find the acceleration of the body of mass m2 in the arrangement shown in figure. If the mass m2 is \u03b7 times great as the mass m1,and the angle that the inclined plane forms with the horizontal is equal to \u03b8. The masses of the pulleys and threads, as well as the friction, are assumed to be negligible. Solution Here, by constraint relation we can see that the acceleration of m2 is two times that of m1. So, we assume if m1 is moving up the inclined plane with an acceleration a, the acceleration of mass m2 going down is 2a. The tensions in different strings are shown in figure. The dynamic equations can be written as For mass m1: 2 1 1 T m g m a \u2212 = sin \u03b8 \u2026(i) For mass m2 : m g T m a 2 2 2 \u2212 = ( ) \u2026(ii) Substituting m m 2 1 = \u03b7 and solving Eqs. (i) and (ii),we get Acceleration of m a g 2 2 2 2 4 1 = = \u2212 + ( sin ) \u03b7 \u03b8 \u03b7 Ans. V Example 23 In the arrangement shown in figure the mass of the ball is \u03b7 times as great as that of the rod. The length of the rod is l, the masses of the pulleys and the threads, as well as the friction, are negligible. The ball is set on the same level as the lower end of the rod and then released. How soon will the ball be opposite the upper end of the rod ? Chapter 8 Laws of Motion \u0097 321 m1 \u03b8 m2 \u03b8 T T m1 m2 2T 2a a 2T  Solution From constraint relation we can see that the acceleration of the rod is double than that of the acceleration of the ball. If ball is going up with an acceleration a, rod will be coming down with the acceleration 2a, thus, the relative acceleration of the ball with respect to rod is 3a in upward direction. If it takes time t seconds to reach the upper end of the rod, we have t l a = 2 3 \u2026(i) Let mass of ball be m and that of rod is M, the dynamic equations of these are For rod Mg T M a \u2212 = ( ) 2 \u2026(ii) For ball 2T mg ma \u2212 = \u2026(iii) Substituting m M = \u03b7 and solving Eqs.

V Example 24 Figure shows a small block A of mass m kept at the left end of a plank B of mass M m = 2 and length l. The system can slide on a horizontal road. The system is started towards right with the initial velocity v. The friction coefficients between the road and the plank is 1/2 and that between the plank and the block is 1/4. Find (a) the time elapsed before the block separates from the plank. (b) displacement of block and plank relative to ground till that moment. Solution There will be relative motion between block and plank and plank and road. So at each surface limiting friction will act. The direction of friction forces at different surfaces are as shown in figure. Here, f mg 1 1 4 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7( ) and f m m g mg 2 1 2 2 3 2 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 + = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ( ) Retardation of A is a f m g 1 1 4 = = 322 \u0097 Mechanics - I A l B A B f1 f1 f2 2T T 2T a 2a T  and retardation of B is a f f m g 2 2 1 2 5 8 = \u2212 = Since, a a 2 1 > Relative acceleration of A with respect to B is a a a g r = \u2212 = 2 1 3 8 Initial velocity of both A and B is v.

For example, Ram is working in a factory. The machine is in working order. Let us work out a plan for the next year, etc. In physics however, the term \u2018work\u2019 has a special meaning. In physics, work is always associated with a force and a displacement. We note that for work to be done, the force must act through a distance. Consider a person holding a weight at a distance \u2018h\u2019 off the floor as shown in figure. In everyday usage, we might say that the man is doing a work, but in our scientific definition, no work is done by a force acting on a stationary object. We could eliminate the effort of holding the weight by merely tying the string to some object and the weight could be supported with no help from us. Let us now see what does \u2018work\u2019 mean in the language of physics. 9.2 Work Done There are mainly three methods of finding work done by a force: (i) Work done by a constant force. (ii) Work done by a variable force. (iii) Work done by the area under force and displacement graph. Work done by a Constant Force Work done by a constant force is given by W = \u22c5 ",

Fig. 9.1  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 Work done by a force may be positive, negative or even zero also, depending on the angle( ) \u03b8 between the force vector F and displacement vector S. Work done by a force is zero when \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 , it is positive when 0 90 \u00b0 \u2264 < \u00b0 \u03b8 and negative when 90 180 \u00b0< \u2264 \u00b0 \u03b8 . For example, when a person lifts a body, the work done by the lifting force is positive (as \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 )but work done by the force of gravity is negative (as \u03b8 = \u00b0 180 ). \u0098 Work depends on frame of reference. With change of frame of reference, inertial force does not change while displacement may change. So, the work done by a force will be different in different frames. For example, if a person is pushing a box inside a moving train, then work done as seen from the frame of reference of train is F S \u22c5 while as seen from the ground it is F S S \u22c5 + ( ) 0 . Here S0, is the displacement of train relative to ground. \u0098 Suppose a body is displaced from point A to point B, then S r r = \u2212 B A = \u2212 + \u2212 + \u2212 ( ) $ ( ) $ ( ) $ x x y y z z B A B A B A i j k Here, ( , , ) x y z A A A and ( , , ) x y z B B B are the co-ordinates of points A and B.

Work Done by a Variable Force So far we have considered the work done by a force which is constant both in magnitude and direction. Let us now consider a force which acts always in one direction but whose magnitude may keep on varying. We can choose the direction of the force as x-axis. Further, let us assume that the magnitude of the force is also a function of x or say F x ( ) is known to us. Now, we are interested in finding the work done by this force in moving a body from x1 to x2. Work done in a small displacement from x to x dx + will be dW F dx = \u22c5 Now, the total work can be obtained by integration of the above elemental work from x1 to x2 or W dW F dx x x x x = = \u22c5 \u222b \u222b 1 2 1 2 364 \u0097 Mechanics - I a a 2g 1g T 20 N a 1kg 2kg 2kg (a) (b) Fig. 9.4 1kg 2kg Fig. 9.3  Note In this method of finding work done, you need not to worry for the sign of work done. If we put proper limits in integration then sign of work done automatically comes. It is important to note that F dx x x 1 2\u222b is also the area under F x - graph between x x = 1 to x x = 2. Spring Force An important example of the above idea is a spring that obeys Hooke\u2019s law. Consider the situation shown in figure. One end of a spring is attached to a fixed vertical support and the other end to a block which can move on a horizontal table. Let x = 0 denote the position of the block when the spring is in its natural length. When the block is displaced by an amount x (either compressed or elongated) a restoring force (F) is applied by the spring on the block. The direction of this force F is always towards its mean position ( ) x = 0 and the magnitude is directly proportional to x or F x \u221d (Hooke\u2019s law) \u2234 F kx = \u2212 \u2026(i) Here, k is a constant called force constant of spring and depends on the nature of spring. From Eq. (i) we see that F is a variable force and F x - graph is a straight line passing through origin with slope = \u2212k. Negative sign in Eq. (i) implies that the spring force F is directed in a direction opposite to the displacement x of the block. Let us now find the work done by this force F when the block is displaced from x = 0 to x x = . This can be obtained either by integration or the area under F x - graph. Thus, W dW Fdx kx dx kx x x = = = \u2212 = \u2212 \u222b \u222b \u222b 0 2 0 1 2 Here, work done is negative because force is in opposite direction of displacement. Similarly, if the block moves from x x = 1 to x x = 2. The limits of integration are x1 and x2 and the work done is W kx dx k x x x x = \u2212 = \u2212 \u222b 1 2 1 2 2 2 1 2 ( ) Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 365 F X F x1 x2 dx X W = Area dW x1 x2 Fig. 9.5 x = 0 F x Fig. 9.6 x = x X F Fig. 9.7  V Example 9.4 A force F x = + ( ) 2 acts on a particle in x-direction where F is in newton and x in metre. Find the work done by this force during a displacement from x m = 1.0 to x m = 2.0 . Solution As the force is variable, we shall find the work done in a small displacement from x to x dx + and then integrate it to find the total work. The work done in this small displacement is dW F dx x dx = = + ( ) 2 Thus, W dW x dx = = + \u222b \u222b 1 0 2 0 1 0 2 0 2 . . . .

Find the work done by this force in displacing the particle from. x a = + to x a = + 2 . Here, k is a positive constant. Solution W F dx = \u222b = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 + +\u222ba a k x dx 2 2 = \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa+ + k x a a 2 = \u2212 k a 2 Ans. Note It is important to note that work comes out to be negative which is quite obvious as the force acting on the particle is in negative x-direction F k x = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 while displacement is along positive x-direction. (from x a = to x a = 2 ) Work Done by Area Under F-S or F -x Graph This method is normally used when force and displacement are either parallel or antiparallel (or one dimensional). As we have discussed above W Fdx =\u222b = area under F x - graph So, work done by a force can be obtained from the area under F x - graph. Unlike the integration method of finding work done in which sign of work done automatically comes after integration, in this method area of the graph will only give us the magnitude of work done. If force and displacement have same sign, work done will be positive and if both have opposite signs, work done is negative. Let us take an example. V Example 9.6 A force F acting on a particle varies with the position x as shown in figure. Find the work done by this force in displacing the particle from (a) x m to x = \u2212 = 2 0 (b) x to x m = = 0 2 . 366 \u0097 Mechanics - I x(m) F(N) \u201310 10 2 \u20132 Fig. 9.8  Solution (a) From x = \u22122m to x = 0, displacement of the particle is along positive x-direction while force acting on the particle is along negative x-direction. Therefore, work done is negative and given by the area under F-x graph with projection along x-axis. \u2234 W = \u2212 = \u2212 1 2 2 10 10 ( ) ( ) J Ans. (b) From x = 0to x = 2 m, displacement of particle and force acting on the particle both are along positive x-direction. Therefore, work done is positive and given by the area under F x- graph, or W = = 1 2 2 10 10 ( ) ( ) J Ans. 1.

A block of mass 2.5 kg is pushed 2.20 m along a frictionless horizontal table by a constant force 16 N directed 45\u00b0 above the horizontal. Determine the work done by (a) the applied force, (b) the normal force exerted by the table, (c) the force of gravity and (d) determine the total work done on the block 3. A block is pulled a distance x along a rough horizontal table by a horizontal string. If the tension in the string is T, the weight of the block is w, the normal reaction is N and frictional force is F. Write down expressions for the work done by each of these forces. 4. A bucket tied to a string is lowered at a constant acceleration of g/4. If mass of the bucket is m and it is lowered by a distance l then find the work done by the string on the bucket. 5.

Here, F is in newton and x in metre. Find the work done by this force when the block is displaced from x = 2 m to x = \u22124 m. 7. A block is constrained to move along x-axis under a force F x x = \u2260 4 0 2 ( ). Here, F is in newton and x in metre. Find the work done by this force when the block is displaced from x = 4 m to x = 2 m. Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 367 45\u00b0 F Fig. 9.9 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 9.1  8. Force acting on a particle varies with displacement as shown in Fig. 9.10. Find the work done by this force on the particle from x = \u22124 m to x = + 4 m. 9. A particle is subjected to a force Fx that varies with position as shown in figure. Find the work done by the force on the body as it moves (a) from x = 10.0 m to x = 5.0 m, (b) from x = 5.0 m to x = 10.0 m, (c) from x = 10.0 m to x = 15.0 m, (d) what is the total work done by the force over the distance x = 0 to x = 15.0 m ? 10. A child applies a force F parallel to the x-axis to a block moving on a horizontal surface. As the child controls the speed of the block, the x-component of the force varies with the x-coordinate of the block as shown in figure. Calculate the work done by the forceF when the block moves (a) from x = 0 to x = 3.0 m (b) from x = 3.0 m to x = 4.0 m (c) from x = 4.0 m to x = 7.0 m (d) from x = 0 to x = 7.0 m 9.3 Conservative and Non-Conservative Forces In the above article, we considered the forces which were although variable but always directed in one direction. However, the most general expression for work done is dW = \u22c5 F dr and W dW i f i f = = \u22c5 \u222b \u222b F dr r r r r Here, dr i j k = + + dx dy dz $ $ $ ri = initial position vector and r f = final position vector Conservative and non-conservative forces can be better understood after going through the following two examples. 368 \u0097 Mechanics - I x(m) F(N) \u201310 10 4 \u20132 \u20134 2 Fig. 9.10 4 3 2 1 0 2 4 6 8 10 12 14 16 Fx (N) x (m) Fig. 9.11 \u2013 1 2 3 2 1 4 6 Fx (N) x (m) Fig. 9.12  V Example 9.7 An object is displaced from point A m m m (2 3 4 , , ) to a point B m m m ( ) 1 2 3 , , under a constant force F i j k = + + ( $ $ $ ) 2 3 4 N.

In the above two examples, we saw that while calculating the work done we did not mention the path along which the object was displaced. Only initial and final coordinates were required. It shows that in both the examples, the work done is path independent or work done will be same along all paths. The forces in which work is path independent are known as conservative forces. Thus, if a particle or an object is displaced from position A to position B through three different paths under a conservative force field. Then, W W W 1 2 3 = = Further, it can be shown that work done in a closed path is zero under a conservative force field. (W W ",

On the other hand, if the work is path dependent or W W W 1 2 3 \u2260 \u2260 , the force is called a non-conservative. Frictional forces, viscous forces are non-conservative in nature. Work done in a closed path is not zero in a non-conservative force field. Note The word potential energy is defined only for conservative forces like gravitational force, electrostatic force and spring force etc. Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 369 A B 1 2 3 Fig. 9.13  Extra Points to Remember We can differentiate the conservative and non-conservative forces in a better way by making a table as given below. S.No Conservative Forces Non-conservative Forces 1. Work done is path independent Work done is path dependent 2. Work done in a closed path is zero Work done in a closed path is not zero 3. The word potential energy is defined for conservative forces The word potential energy is not defined for non-conservative forces. 4. Examples are: gravitational force, electrostatic force, spring force etc. Examples are: frictional force, viscous force etc. \u0098 Gravitational force is a conservative force. Its work done is path independent. For small heights it only depends on the height difference \u2018h\u2019 between two points. Work done by gravitational force is ( ) \u00b1 mgh , in moving the mass \u2018m\u2019 from one point to another point. This is( ) + mgh if the mass is moving downwards (as the force mg and displacement both are downwards, in the same direction) and ( ) \u2212mgh if the mass is moving upwards. \u0098 The magnetic field (and therefore the magnetic force) is neither conservative nor non-conservative. \u0098 Electric field (and therefore electric force) is produced either by static charge or by time varying magnetic field. First is conservative and the other non-conservative. 9.4 Kinetic Energy Kinetic energy (KE) is the capacity of a body to do work by virtue of its motion. If a body of mass m has a velocity v, its kinetic energy is equivalent to the work which an external force would have to do to bring the body from rest upto its velocity v. The numerical value of the kinetic energy can be calculated from the formula. KE = 1 2 2 mv This can be derived as follows: Consider a constant force F which acting on a mass m initially at rest. This force provides the mass m a velocity v. If in reaching this velocity, the particle has been moving with an acceleration a and has been given a displacement s, then F ma = (Newton\u2019s law) v as 2 2 = Work done by the constant force = Fs or W ma v a mv = \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7= ( ) 2 2 2 1 2 370 \u0097 Mechanics - I A B W mgh AB = \u2013 W mgh BA = + h Fig. 9.14  But the kinetic energy of the body is equivalent to the work done in giving the body this velocity. Hence, KE = 1 2 2 mv Regarding the kinetic energy the following two points are important to note: 1. Since, both m and v 2 are always positive. KE is always positive and does not depend on the direction of motion of the body. 2. Kinetic energy depends on the frame of reference. For example, the kinetic energy of a person of mass m sitting in a train moving with speed v is zero in the frame of train but 1 2 2 mv in the frame of earth. 9.5 Work Energy Theorem This theorem is a very important tool that relates the works to kinetic energy. According to this theorem: Work done by all the forces (conservative or non-conservative, external or internal) acting on a particle or an object is equal to the change in kinetic  energy of it. \u2234 W K K f i net ",

Thus, work energy theorem can also be written as: work done by the resultant force which is also equal to the sum of the work done by the individual forces is equal to change in kinetic energy. Regarding the work-energy theorem it is worthnoting that : (i) If Wnet is positive then K K f i \u2212 = positive, i.e. K K f i > or kinetic energy will increase and if Wnet is negative then kinetic energy will decrease. (ii) This theorem can be applied to non-inertial frames also. In a non-inertial frame it can be written as work done by all the forces (including the pseudo forces) = change in kinetic energy in non-inertial frame. Let us take an example.

There is no relative motion between block and plank. Hence, force of friction on block is f ma = in forward direction. Refer Figure (b) Horizontal force on the block has been shown from ground (inertial) frame of reference. If the plank moves a distance s on the ground, the block will also move the same distance s (as there is no slipping between the two). Hence, work done by friction on the block (w.r.t. ground) is W fs mas f = = From work-energy principle if v is the speed of block (w.r.t. ground), then KE = Wf or 1 2 2 mv mas = or v as = 2 Thus, velocity of block relative to ground is 2as.

For example, a block attached to a compressed or elongated spring possesses some energy called elastic potential energy. This block has a capacity to do work. Similarly, a stone when released from a certain height also has energy in the form of gravitational potential energy. Two charged particles kept at certain distance has electric potential energy. Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 375 v (m/s) t (s) 2 20 Fig. 9.20 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 9.2  Regarding the potential energy it is important to note that it is defined for a conservative force field only. For non-conservative forces it has no meaning. The change in potential energy ( ) dU of a system corresponding to a conservative force is given by dU dW = \u2212 \u22c5 = \u2212 F dr or dU i f i f = \u2212 \u22c5 \u222b \u222b F dr r r or \u2206U U U f i i f = \u2212 = \u2212 \u22c5 \u222b F dr r r We generally choose the reference point at infinity and assume potential energy to be zero there, i.e. if we take ri = \u221e(infinite) andU i = 0 then we can write U W = \u2212 \u22c5 = \u2212 \u221d\u222b F dr r or potential energy of a body or system is the negative of work done by the conservative forces in bringing it from infinity to the present position. Regarding the potential energy it is worth noting that: 1. Potential energy can be defined only for conservative forces and it should be considered to be a property of the entire system rather than assigning it to any specific particle. 2. Potential energy depends on frame of reference. 3. If conservative force F and potential energy associated with this forceU are functions of single variable r or x then : F dU dr = \u2212 or \u2212dU dx Now, let us discuss three types of potential energies which we usually come across. Elastic Potential Energy In Article 9.2, we have discussed the spring forces. We have seen there that the work done by the spring force (of course conservative for an ideal spring) is \u22121 2 2 kx when the spring is stretched or compressed by an amount x from its unstretched position. Thus, U W kx = \u2212 = \u2212\u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 2 2 or U kx = 1 2 2 (k = spring constant) Note that elastic potential energy is always positive. Gravitational Potential Energy The gravitational potential energy of two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r is given by U G m m r = \u2212 1 2 Here, G = universal gravitation constant = \u00d7 \u2212 6.67 N-m kg 2 2 10 11 376 \u0097 Mechanics - I  Extra Points to Remember If a body of mass m is raised to a height h from the surface of earth, the change in potential energy of the system (earth + body) comes out to be \u2206U mgh h R = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 (R = radius of earth) or \u2206U mgh \u2248 if h R << Thus, the potential energy of a body at height h, i.e. mgh is really the change in potential energy of the system for h R << . So, be careful while usingU mgh = , that h should not be too large. This we will discuss in detail in the chapter of Gravitation. Electric Potential Energy The electric potential energy of two point charges q1 and q2 separated by a distance r in vacuum is given by U q q r = \u03b5 \u22c5 1 4 0 1 2 \u03c0 Here, 1 4 9 0 10 0 9 \u03c0\u03b5 = \u00d7 = . N-m C constant 2 2 \u0098 Elastic potential energy is either zero or positive, but gravitational and electric potential energy may be zero, positive or negative. \u0098 For increase or decrease in gravitational potential energy of a particle (for small heights) we write, \u2206U mgh = Here, h is the change in height of particle. In case of a rigid body, h of centre of mass of the rigid body is seen. \u0098 Change in potential energy is equal to the negative of work done by the conservative force( ) \u2206 \u2206 U W = \u2212 . If work done by the conservative force is negative, change in potential energy will be positive or potential energy of the system will increase and vice-versa. This can be understood by a simple example. Suppose a ball is taken from the ground to some height, work done by gravity is negative, i.e. change in potential energy should increase or potential energy of the ball will increase. \u2206Wgravity ve = \u2212 \u2234 \u2206U = + ve ( ) \u2206 \u2206 U W = \u2212 or U U f i \u2212 = + ve \u0098 F dU dr = \u2212 , i.e. conservative forces always act in a direction where potential energy of the system is decreased. This can also be shown as in Fig 9.22. If a ball is dropped from a certain height. The force on it (its weight) acts in a direction in which its potential energy decreases. Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 377 Ground Fig. 9.21 F Fig. 9.22  V Example 9.13 A chain of mass \u2018m\u2019 and length \u2018l\u2019 is kept in three positions as shown below. Assuming h =0 on the ground find potential energy of the chain in all three cases. Solution For finding potential energy of chain we will have to see its centre of mass height \u2018h\u2019 from ground. In figure (a): hc = 0\u21d2Potential energy,U = 0 In figure (b): h h c = \u21d2Potential energy,U mgh = In figure (c): h l c = 2 \u21d2Potential energy,U mg l = 2 V Example 9.14 Potential energy of a body in position A is \u221240 J. Work done by conservative force in moving the body from A to B is \u221220 J. Find potential energy of the body in position B. Solution Work done by a conservative force is given by W U U U U U A B B A A B \u2192 = \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212 = \u2212 \u2206 ( ) \u21d2 U U W B A A B = \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212\u2212 \u2192 ( ) ( ) 40 20 = \u221220 J Ans. 1. If work done by a conservative force is positive then select the correct option(s). (a) potential energy will decrease (b) potential energy may increase or decrease (c) kinetic energy will increase (d) kinetic energy may increase or decrease. 2. Work done by a conservative force in bringing a body from infinity to A is 60 J and to B is 20 J. What is the difference in potential energy between points A and B, i.e. U U B A \u2212 . 9.7 Three Types of Equilibrium A body is said to be in translatory equilibrium, if net force acting on the body is zero, i.e. Fnet = 0 If the forces are conservative F dU dr = \u2212 and for equilibrium F = 0. So, \u2212 = dU dr 0, or dU dr = 0 378 \u0097 Mechanics - I INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 9.3 (a) (b) (c) C C C h Ground Fig. 9.23  i.e. at equilibrium position slope of U-r graph is zero or the potential energy is optimum (maximum, minimum or constant). Equilibrium are of three types, i.e. the situation where F = 0 and dU dr = 0 can be obtained under three conditions. These are stable equilibrium, unstable equilibrium and neutral equilibrium. These three types of equilibrium can be better understood from the given three figures. Three identical balls are placed in equilibrium in positions as shown in figures (a), (b) and (c) respectively. In Fig. (a), ball is placed inside a smooth spherical shell. This ball is in stable equilibrium position. In Fig. (b), the ball is placed over a smooth sphere. This is in unstable equilibrium position. In Fig. (c), the ball is placed on a smooth horizontal ground. This ball is in neutral equilibrium position. The table given below explains what is the difference and what are the similarities between these three equilibrium positions in the language of physics. Table 9.1 S. No. Stable Equilibrium Unstable Equilibrium Neutral Equilibrium 1. Net force is zero. Net force is zero. Net force is zero. 2. dU dr = 0 or slope of U-r graph is zero. dU dr = 0 or slope of U-r graph is zero. dU dr = 0 or slope of U-r graph is zero. 3. When displaced from its equilibrium position a net restoring force starts acting on the body which has a tendency to bring the body back to its equilibrium position. When displaced from its equilibrium position, a net force starts acting on the body which moves the body in the direction of displacement or away from the equilibrium position. When displaced from its equilibrium position the body has neither the tendency to come back nor to move away from the original position. It is again in equilibrium. 4. Potential energy in equilibrium position is minimum as compared to its neighbouring points. or d U dr 2 2 = positive Potential energy in equilibrium position is maximum as compared to its neighbouring points. or d U dr 2 2 = negative Potential energy remains constant even if the body is displaced from its equilibrium position. or d U dr 2 2 0 = 5. When displaced from equilibrium position the centre of gravity of the body goes up. When displaced from equilibrium position the centre of gravity of the body comes down. When displaced from equilibrium position the centre of gravity of the body remains at the same level. Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 379 (a) (b) (c) Fig. 9.24  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 If we plot graphs between F and r or U and r, F will be zero at equilibrium while U will be maximum, minimum or constant depending on the type of equilibrium. This all is shown in Fig. 9.24 At point A, F dU dr = = 0 0 , , but U is constant. Hence, A is neutral equilibrium position. At points B and D, F dU dr = = 0 0 , but U is maximum. Thus, these are the points of unstable equilibrium. At point C F dU dr , , = = 0 0, but U is minimum. Hence, point C is in stable equilibrium position. \u0098 Oscillations of a body take place about stable equilibrium position. For example, bob of a pendulum oscillates about its lowest point which is also the stable equilibrium position of the bob. Similarly, in Fig. 9.26 (b), the ball will oscillate about its stable equilibrium position. \u0098 If a graph between F and r is as shown in figure, then F = 0, at r r = 1, r r = 2 and r r = 3. Therefore, at these three points, body is in equilibrium. But these three positions are three different types of equilibriums. For example : at r r = 1, body is in unstable equilibrium. This is because, if we displace the body slightly rightwards (positive direction), force acting on the body is also positive, i.e. away from r r = 1 position. At r r = 2, body is in stable equilibrium. Because if we displace the body rightwards (positive direction) force acting on the body is negative  (or leftwards) or the force acting is restoring in nature. At r r = 3, equilibrium is neutral in nature. Because if we displace the body rightwards or leftwards force is again zero. 380 \u0097 Mechanics - I A B C D U r A B C D F r Fig. 9.25 (a) (b) Fig. 9.26 F r r1 r2 r3 Fig. 9.27  V Example 9.15 For the potential energy curve shown in figure.

So. it is stable equilibrium position. At x = 2m, potential energy is maximum. So, it is unstable equilibrium position. There is no point, where potential energy is constant. So, we don't have any point of unstable equilibrium position. V Example 9.16 The potential energy of a conservative force field is given by U ax bx = \u2212 2 where, a and b are positive constants. Find the equilibrium position and discuss whether the equilibrium is stable, unstable or neutral. Solution In a conservative field F dU dx = \u2212 \u2234 F d dx ax bx = \u2212 \u2212 ( ) 2 = \u2212 b ax 2 For equilibrium F = 0 or b ax \u2212 = 2 0 \u2234 x b a = 2 From the given equation we can see that d U dx a 2 2 2 = (positive), i.e. U is minimum. Therefore, x b a = 2 is the stable equilibrium position. Ans. Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 381 A U B 2 4 C D E 6 8 x (m) Fig. 9.28  1.

Force acting on a particle constrained to move along x-axis is F x = \u2212 ( ). 4 Here, F is in newton and x in metre. Find the equilibrium position and state whether it is stable or unstable equilibrium. 9.8 Power of a Force Power of a force is the rate of work done by this force. Now, power may be of two types: (i) Instantaneous power (Pi or P) (ii) Average power (Pav) Instantaneous Power The rate of doing work done by a force at a given instant is called instantaneous power of this force. Thus, P dW dt = = \u22c5 F r d dt (as dW d = \u22c5 F r) = \u22c5 F v (as d dt r v = ) = Fvcos\u03b8 \u2234 P dW dt Fv = = \u22c5 = F v cos\u03b8 Here, \u03b8 is the angle between F andv. Hence power of a force is the dot product of this force and instantaneous velocity. If angle between F and v is acute then dot product is positive (or cos\u03b8 is positive). So, power is positive. If angle is 90\u00b0, then dot product,cos\u03b8 and hence power are zero. If\u03b8 is obtuse, then dot product, cos\u03b8 and hence power are negative. 382 \u0097 Mechanics - I A F B C D x E Fig. 9.29 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 9.4  Average Power The ratio of total work done and total time is defined as the average power. Thus: P W av = Total total t V Example 9.17 A ball of mass 1 kg is dropped from a tower. Find power of gravitational force at time t s =2 . Take g m s =10 2 / .

There are either no other forces or the work done by them is zero. We have U U W f i \u2212 = \u2212 and W K K f i = \u2212 (from work energy theorem) then U U K K f i f i \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212 ( ) or U K U K f f i i + = + \u2026(i) The sum of the potential energy and the kinetic energy is called the total mechanical energy. We see from Eq. (i), that the total mechanical energy of a system remains constant, if only conservative forces are acting on a system of particles and the work done by all other forces is zero. This is called the conservation of mechanical energy. The total mechanical energy is not constant, if non-conservative forces such as friction is also acting on the system. However, the work energy theorem, is still valid. Thus, we can apply W W W K K c nc f i + + = \u2212 ext Here, W U U c f i = \u2212 \u2212 ( ) So, we get W W K U K U nc f f i i + = + \u2212 + ext ( ) ( ) or W W E E E nc f i + = \u2212 = ext \u2206 Here, E K U = + is the total mechanical energy. \u0098 Work done by conservative forces is equal to minus of change in potential energy W U U U U U c f i i f = \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212 = \u2212 \u2206 ( ) \u0098 Work done by all the forces is equal to change in kinetic energy. W K K K f i all = = \u2212 \u2206 \u0098 Work done by the forces other than the conservative forces (non-conservative + external forces) is equal to change in mechanical energy W W E E E nc f i + = = \u2212 ext \u2206 = + \u2212 + ( ) ( ) K U K U f f i i \u0098 If there are no non-conservative forces, then W E E E f i ext = = \u2212 \u2206 Further, in this case if no information is given regarding the change in kinetic energy then we can take it zero. In that case, W U U U f i ext = = \u2212 \u2206 V Example 9.19 A body is displaced from position A to position B. Kinetic and potential energies of the body at positions A and B are K J A = 50 ,U J A = \u221230 , K J B =10 andU J B = 20 . Find work done by (a) conservative forces (b) all forces (c) forces other than conservative forces. 384 \u0097 Mechanics - I  Solution (a) W U U U c f i = \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212 \u2206 ( ) = \u2212 U U i f = \u2212 U U A B = \u2212 \u2212 30 20= \u221250J Ans. (b) W K K K all f i = = \u2212 \u2206 = \u2212 K K B A = \u2212 10 50= \u221240J Ans.

Note Work done by conservative force is negative ( ) = \u221250 J . Therefore potential energy should increase and we can see that, U U f i > as U U B A > Final Touch Points 1. Suppose a particle is released from point A with u = 0. . Friction is absent everywhere. Then velocity at B will be v gh = 2 (irrespective of the track it follows from A to B) Here, h h h A B = \u2212 2. In circular motion, centripetal force acts towards the centre. This force is perpendicular to small displacement dS and velocity v. Hence, work done by it is zero and power of this force is also zero. Chapter 9 Work, Energy and Power \u0097 385 v B A h u = 0  ",

Type 2. Based on the position of equilibrium and momentary rest. Concept In the figure shown, block attached with the spring is released from rest at natural length of the spring at A. At this position a constant force mg is acting on the block in downward direction. So, block starts moving downwards and spring is stretched. So, a variable spring force kx starts acting on the block in upward direction which keeps on increasing with extension \u2018x\u2019. In position B, also called equilibrium position, kx mg = \u2234 Fnet = 0 But the block does not stop here. Rather, it has maximum velocity in this position. After crossing B the block retards, as kx mg > and net force is upwards. At point C (the maximum extension) block stops for a moment ( ) v = 0 and then it returns back. The block starts oscillating between A and C. 388 \u0097 Mechanics - I m m m A B C K mg kx B 37\u00b0 I A B d Rod Ring v = 0 h v  Thus, From kx and mg Direction of net force Direction of velocity Speed A to B mg kx > Downwards Downwards Increasing at B mg kx = Fnet = 0 - Maximum B to C kx mg > Upwards Downwards Decreasing C to B kx mg > Upwards Upwards Increasing B to A mg kx > Downwards Upwards Decreasing Note (i) Points A and C are the points of momentary rest, wherev =0 but Fnet \u22600.

(b) If both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion. (c) If Assertion is true, but the Reason is false. (d) If Assertion is false but the Reason is true. 1. Assertion : Power of a constant force is also constant. Reason : Net constant force will always produce a constant acceleration. 2. Assertion : A body is moved from x = 2 to x = 1, under a force F x = 4 , the work done by this force is negative. Reason : Force and displacement are in opposite directions. 3. Assertion : If work done by conservative forces is positive, kinetic energy will increase. Reason : Because potential energy will decrease. 4. Assertion : In circular motion work done by all the forces acting on the body is zero. Reason : Centripetal force and velocity are mutually perpendicular. 5. Assertion : Corresponding to displacement- time graph of a particle moving in a straight line we can say that total work done by all the forces acting on the body is positive. Reason : Speed of particle is increasing. 6. Assertion : Work done by a constant force is path independent. Reason : All constant forces are conservative in nature. 7. Assertion : Work-energy theorem can be applied for non-inertial frames also. Reason : Earth is a non-inertial frame. 8. Assertion : A wooden block is floating in a liquid as shown in figure. In vertical direction equilibrium of block is stable. Reason : When depressed in downward direction is starts oscillating. Exercises s t  9. Assertion : Displacement-time graph of a particle moving in a straight line is shown in figure. Work done by all the forces between time interval t t 1 2 and is definitely zero. Reason : Work done by all the forces is equal to change in kinetic energy. 10. Assertion : All surfaces shown in figure are smooth. Block A comes down along the wedge B. Work done by normal reaction (between A B and ) on B is positive while on A it is negative. Reason : Angle between normal reaction and net displacement of A is greater than 90\u00b0 while between normal reaction and net displacement of B is less than 90\u00b0. 11. Assertion : A plank A is placed on a rough surface over which a block B is placed. In the shown situation, elastic cord is unstretched. Now a gradually increasing force F is applied slowly on A until the relative motion between the block and plank starts. At this moment cord is making an angle \u03b8 with the vertical. Work done by force F is equal to energy lost against friction f2, plus potential energy stored in the cord. Reason : Work done by static friction f1 on the system as a whole is zero. 12. Assertion : A block of mass m starts moving on a rough horizontal surface with a velocity v. It stops due to friction between the block and the surface after moving through a ceratin distance. The surface is now tilted to an angle of 30\u00b0 with the horizontal and the same block is made to go up on the surface with the same initial velocity v. The decrease in the mechanical energy in the second situation is smaller than that in the first situation. Reason : The coefficient of friction between the block and the surface decreases with the increase in the angle of inclination.

This plane may be horizontal, inclined or vertical. But in most of the cases, this plane is horizontal. In circular motion, direction of velocity continuously keeps on changing. Therefore, even though speed is constant and velocity keeps on changing. So body is accelerated. Later we will see that this is a variable acceleration. So, we cannot apply the equations v u a = + t etc. directly. 10.2 Kinematics of Circular Motion Velocity In circular motion, a particle has two velocities : (i) Angular velocity (ii) Linear velocity Angular Velocity Suppose a particle P is moving in a circle of radius r and centre O. The position of the particle P at a given instant may be described by the angle \u03b8 between OP and OX. This angle \u03b8 is called the angular position of the particle. As the particle moves on the circle its angular position \u03b8 changes. Suppose the point rotates an angle \u2206\u03b8 in time \u2206t. The rate of change of angular position is known as the angular velocity ( ). Thus, \u03c9 \u03b8 \u03b8 = = \u2192 lim \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 t t d dt 0 Here, \u03c9 is the angular speed or magnitude of angular velocity. Angular velocity is a vector quantity. Direction of \u03c9 is perpendicular to plane of circle and given by screw law. In the Fig. 10.2 (a), when the particle is rotating clockwise, direction of \u03c9 is perpendicular to paper inwards or in \u2297direction. In Fig. 10.2 (b), when the particle is rotating in anticlockwise direction, direction of \u03c9 is perpendicular to paper outwards or in O. direction. Linear velocity is as usual, v s = d dt or d dt r Magnitude of linear velocity is called linear speed v. Thus, v d dt d dt = = v s r or O X r P \u2206\u03b8 \u03b8 Y P\u2032 Fig. 10.1 (a) (b) Fig. 10.2  Relation between Linear Speed and Angular Speed In the Fig. 10.1, linear distance PP\u2032 travelled by the particle in time \u2206t is \u2206 \u2206 s r = \u03b8 or lim lim \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 \u2206 t t s t r t \u2192 \u2192 = 0 0 \u03b8 or ds dt r d dt = \u03b8 or v r = \u03c9 Acceleration Like the velocity, a particle in circular motion has two accelerations: (i) Angular acceleration (ii) Linear acceleration The rate of change of angular velocity is called the angular acceleration ( ) \u03b1 . Thus, \u03b1 \u03c9 \u03b8 = = d dt d dt 2 2 Angular acceleration is also a vector quantity. Direction of \u03b1 is also perpendicular to plane of circle, either parallel or antiparallel to \u03c9. If angular speed of the particle is increasing, then \u03b1 is parallel to \u03c9 and if angular speed is decreasing, then \u03b1 is antiparallel to \u03c9. Angular acceleration is zero if angular speed (or angular velocity) is constant. In circular motion, linear speed of the particle may or may not be constant but direction of linear velocity continuously keeps on changing. So, velocity is continuously changing. Therefore, acceleration cannot be zero. But of course we can resolve the linear acceleration into two components: (i) tangential acceleration ( ) at (ii) radial or centripetal acceleration ( ) ar Component of linear acceleration in tangential direction is called tangential acceleration ( ) at . This component is responsible for change in linear speed. This is the rate of change of speed. Thus, a dv dt d dt t = = v If speed of the particle is constant, then at is zero. If speed is increasing, then this is positive and in the direction of linear velocity. If speed is decreasing, then this component is negative and in the opposite direction of linear velocity. Tangential component of the linear acceleration and angular acceleration have following relation: a dv dt d r dt r d dt t = = = ( ) \u03c9 \u03c9 = r\u03b1 (as d dt \u03c9 \u03b1 = ) \u2234 a r t = \u03b1 Chapter 10 Circular Motion \u0097 431  Component of linear acceleration in radial direction (towards centre) is called radial or centripetal acceleration. This component is responsible for change in direction of linear velocity. So, this component can never be zero, as the direction continuously keeps on changing. Value of this component is a v r r r = = 2 2 \u03c9 (as v r = \u03c9) These two components are mutually perpendicular. So, the net linear acceleration is the vector sum of these two, as shown in figure. a a a t r = + 2 2 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 + \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 dv dt v r 2 2 2 or a r r = + ( ) ( ) \u03b1 \u03c9 2 2 2 and tan\u03b8 = a a r t or \u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 tan 1 a a r t Three Types of Circular Motion For better understanding, we can classify the circular motion in following three types: (i) Uniform circular motion in which v and \u03c9 are constant. In this motion, v or v = constant \u21d2 at = 0 \u21d2\u03c9 = constant \u21d2\u03b1 = 0 a a v r r r = = = 2 2 \u03c9 a is towards centre, v is tangential and according to the shown figure,\u03c9is perpendicular to paper inwards or in \u2297direction. (ii) Accelerated circular motion in which v and\u03c9 are increasing. So, at is in the direction of v and \u03b1 is in the direction of \u03c9. In the figure shown, \u03b1 and \u03c9 both are perpendicular to paper inwards. Further, a a a t r = + 2 2 and tan\u03b8 = a a r t (iii) Retarded circular motion in which v and\u03c9 are decreasing. So, at is in the opposite direction of v and \u03b1 is in the opposite direction of \u03c9. In the figure shown,\u03c9 is perpendicular to paper inwards in \u2297direction and \u03b1 is perpendicular to paper outwards in O. direction. Note In the above figures, \u03b8 is the angle between v and a. 432 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u03b8 at ar a Fig. 10.3 \u03b8 ar a \u03b8 is acute v at Fig. 10.5 \u03b8 a a = r P v \u03b8 = 90\u00b0 Fig. 10.4 \u03b8 ar \u03b8 is obtuse v at a Fig. 10.6  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 Relation between angular velocity vector\u03c9,velocity vector vand position vector of the particle with respect to centre r is given by v r = \u00d7 \u03c9 \u0098 In circular motion, if angular acceleration\u03b1 is constant then we can apply the following equations directly: \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b1 = + 0 t \u21d2 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b1\u03b8 2 0 2 2 = + and \u03b8 \u03c9 \u03b1 = + 0 2 1 2 t t Here,\u03c90 is the initial angular velocity and\u03c9, the angular velocity at time t. Similarly,\u03b8is the angle rotated by position vector of the particle (with respect to centre). \u0098 If angular acceleration is not constant, then we will have to take help of differentiation or integration. The basic equations are \u03c9 \u03b8 = d dt and \u03b1 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b8 = = d dt d d \u2234 d dt \u03b8 \u03c9 = \u222b \u222b , d dt \u222b \u222b = \u03c9 \u03b1 and \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u222b \u222b = d d V Example 10.1 A particle moves in a circle of radius 0.5 m at a speed that uniformly increases. Find the angular acceleration of particle if its speed changes from 2.0 m/s to 4.0 m/s in 4.0 s. Solution The tangential acceleration of the particle is a dv dt t = = \u2212 4.0 2.0 4.0 = 0.5 m s 2 / The angular acceleration is \u03b1 = a r t = 0.5 0.5 = 1rad s 2 / Ans. V Example 10.2 The speed of a particle moving in a circle of radius r m = 2 varies with time t as v t = 2, where t is in second and v in m/s. Find the radial, tangential and net acceleration at t s = 2 . Solution Linear speed of particle at t = 2s is v = = ( ) / 2 4 2 m s \u2234Radial acceleration a v r r = 2 = ( ) 4 2 2 = 8 m s 2 / The tangential acceleration is a dv dt t t = = 2 \u2234Tangential acceleration at t = 2s is at = = ( ) ( ) / 2 2 4 m s 2 \u2234Net acceleration of particle at t = 2s is a a a r t = + ( ) ( ) 2 2 = + ( ) ( ) 8 4 2 2 or a = 80 m s 2 / Note On any curved path (not necessarily a circular one) the acceleration of the particle has two components at and an in two mutually perpendicular directions. Component ofa along v is at and perpendicular to v is an. Thus, | | a = + a a t n 2 2 Chapter 10 Circular Motion \u0097 433  V Example 10.3 In circular motion, what are the possible values (zero, positive or negative) of the following : (a) \u03c9\u22c5v (b) v a \u22c5 (c) \u03c9 \u03b1 \u22c5 Solution (a) v lies in the plane of circle and \u03c9 is always perpendicular to this plane. \u2234 v\u22a5\u03c9 (always) Hence, \u03c9\u22c5vis always zero. (b) vand a both lie in the plane of circle and the angle between these two vectors may be acute (when speed is increasing) obtuse (when speed is decreasing) or 90\u00b0 (when speed is constant). Hence, v a \u22c5 may be positive, negative or zero. (c) \u03c9 and \u03b1 are either parallel (\u03b8 = \u00b0 0 between \u03c9 and \u03b1) or antiparallel (\u03b8 = \u00b0 180 ). In uniform circular motion, \u03b1 has zero magnitude. Hence, \u03c9 \u03b1 \u22c5 may be positive, negative or zero. 1.

So, normally we resolve the forces acting on the particle in two directions: (i) tangential (ii) radial In tangential direction, net force on the particle is mat and in radial direction net force is mar . In uniform circular motion, tangential acceleration is zero. Hence, net force in tangential direction is zero and in radial direction F ma mv r mr r net = = = 2 2 \u03c9 as, a v r r r = = 2 2 \u03c9 This net force (towards centre) is also called centripetal force. In most of the cases plane of our uniform circular motion will be horizontal and one of the tangent is in vertical direction also. So, in this case we resolve the forces in: (i) horizontal radial direction (ii) vertical tangential direction In vertical tangential direction net force is zero (at =0) and in horizontal radial direction (towards centre) net force is mv r 2 or mr\u03c92. Note Centripetal force mv r 2 or mr \u03c92(towards centre) does not act on the particle but this much force is required to the particle for rotating in a circle (as it is accelerated due to change in direction of velocity). The real forces acting on the particle provide this centripetal force or we can say that vector sum of all the forces acting on the particle is equal to mv r 2 or mr \u03c92 (in case of uniform circular motion). The real forces acting on the particle may be, friction force, weight, normal reaction, tension etc. Conical Pendulum If a small particle of mass m tied to a string is whirled in a horizontal circle, as shown in Fig.10.8. The arrangement is called the \u2018conical pendulum\u2019. In case of conical pendulum, the vertical component of tension balances the weight in tangential direction, while its horizontal component provides the necessary centripetal force in radial direction (towards centre). Thus, T mv r sin \u03b8 = 2 \u2026(i) and T mg cos \u03b8 = \u2026(ii) Chapter 10 Circular Motion \u0097 435 r \u03b8 T L m mg \u03b8 r = L sin \u03b8 Fig. 10.8  From these two equations, we can find v rg = tan \u03b8 \u2234Angular speed \u03c9 \u03b8 = = v r g r tan So, the time period of pendulum is T r g = = 2 2 \u03c0 \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03b8 tan = 2\u03c0 \u03b8 L g cos ( sin ) as r L = \u03b8 or T L g = 2\u03c0 \u03b8 cos Motion of a Particle Inside a Smooth Cone A particle of mass \u2018m\u2019 is rotating inside a smooth cone in horizontal circle of radius \u2018r\u2019 as shown in figure. constant speed of the particle is suppose \u2018v\u2019. Only two forces are acting on the particle in the shown directions: (i) normal reaction N (ii) weight mg We have resolved these two forces in vertical tangential direction and horizontal radial direction. In vertical tangential direction, net force is zero. \u2234 N mg cos\u03b8 = In horizontal radial direction (towards centre), net force is mv r 2 . \u2234 N mv r sin\u03b8 = 2 \u2018Death Well\u2019 or Rotor In case of \u2018death well\u2019 a person drives a bicycle on a vertical surface of a large wooden well while in case of a rotor, at a certain angular speed of rotor a person hangs resting against the wall without any support from the bottom. In death well walls are at rest and person revolves while in case of rotor person is at rest and the walls rotate. In both cases, friction force balances the weight of person while reaction provides the centripetal force for circular motion, i.e. f mg = and N mv r mr = = 2 2 \u03c9 ( ) v r = \u03c9 436 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u03b8 r C mg N cos \u03b8 N sin \u03b8 N \u03b8 mg m Fig. 10.9 mg f N r r f N mg (A) Death well (B) Rotor Fig. 10.10  A Cyclist Bends Towards Centre on a Circular Path In the figure, F is the resultant of N and f . \u2234 F N f = + 2 2 When the cyclist is inclined to the centre of the rounding of its path, the resultant of N f , and mg is directed horizontally to the centre of the circular path of the cycle. This resultant force imparts a centripetal acceleration to the cyclist. Resultant of N and f , i.e. F should pass through G, the centre of gravity of cyclist (for complete equilibrium, rotational as well as translational). Hence, tan \u03b8 = f N , where f mv r = 2 and N mg = \u2234 tan \u03b8 = v rg 2 Circular Turning of Roads When vehicles go through turnings, they travel along a nearly circular arc. There must be some force which will provide the required centripetal acceleration. If the vehicles travel in a horizontal circular path, this resultant force is also horizontal. The necessary centripetal force is being provided to the vehicles by following three ways: 1. By friction only. 2. By banking of roads only. 3. By friction and banking of roads both. In real life, the necessary centripetal force is provided by friction and banking of roads both. Now, let us write equations of motion in each of the three cases separately and see what are the constraints in each case. 1. By Friction Only Suppose a car of mass m is moving at a speed v in a horizontal circular arc of radius r. In this case, the necessary centripetal force to the car will be provided by force of friction f acting towards centre. Thus, f mv r = 2 Further, limiting value of f is \u00b5N. or f N L = \u00b5 = \u00b5mg ( ) N mg = Therefore, for a safe turn without sliding mv r f L 2 \u2264 or mv r mg 2 \u2264\u00b5 or \u00b5 \u2265v rg 2 or v rg \u2264 \u00b5 Chapter 10 Circular Motion \u0097 437 N \u03b8 G \u03b8 f mg G mg F mv r 2 Fig. 10.11  Here, two situations may arise. If\u00b5 and r are known to us, the speed of the vehicle should not exceed \u00b5rg and if v and r are known to us, the coefficient of friction should be greater than v rg 2 . Note You might have seen that if the speed of the car is too high, car starts skidding outwards. With this, radius of the circle increases or the necessary centripetal force is reduced (centripetal force \u221d1 r ) . 2. By Banking of Roads Only Friction is not always reliable at circular turns if high speeds and sharp turns are involved. To avoid dependence on friction, the roads are banked at the turn so that the outer part of the road is some what lifted compared to the inner part. Applying Newton\u2019s second law along the radius and the first law in the vertical direction. N mv r sin \u03b8 = 2 ...(i) and N mg cos \u03b8 = ...(ii) From these two equations, we get tan \u03b8 = v rg 2 or v rg = tan \u03b8 Note This is the speed at which car does not slide down even if track is smooth. If track is smooth and speed is less than rg tan , \u03b8 vehicle will move down so that r gets decreased and if speed is more than this vehicle will move up. 3. By Friction and Banking of Road Both If a vehicle is moving on a circular road which is rough and banked also, then three forces may act on the vehicle of these the first force, i.e. weight ( ) mg is fixed both in magnitude and direction. The direction of second force, i.e. normal reaction N is also fixed (perpendicular to the road) while the direction of the third force, i.e. friction f can be either inwards or outwards, while its magnitude can be varied from zero to a maximum limit ( ) f N L = \u00b5 . So, the magnitude of normal reaction N and direction plus magnitude of friction f are so adjusted that the resultant of the three forces mentioned above is mv r 2 towards the centre. Of these m and r are also constant. Therefore, magnitude of N and direction plus magnitude of friction mainly depend on the speed of the vehicle v. Although situation varies from problem to problem yet, we can see that (i) Friction f is upwards if the vehicle is at rest or v = 0. Because in this case the component of weight mg sin \u03b8 is balanced by f. (ii) Friction f is downwards if v rg > tan \u03b8 (iii) Friction f is upwards if v rg < tan \u03b8 (iv) Friction f is zero if v rg = tan \u03b8 438 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u03b8 mg N \u03b8 G mv r 2 Fig. 10.12  Let us now see how the force of friction and normal reaction change as speed is gradually increased. In Fig. (a) When the car is at rest force of friction is upwards. We can resolve the forces in any two mutually perpendicular directions. Let us resolve them in horizontal and vertical directions. \u03a3 FH = 0 \u2234 N f sin \u2013 cos \u03b8 \u03b8 = 0 \u2026(i) \u03a3 FV = 0 \u2234 N f mg cos sin \u03b8 \u03b8 + = \u2026(ii) In Fig. (b) Now, the car is given a small speed v, so that a centripetal force mv r 2 is now required in horizontal direction towards centre. So, Eq. (i) will now become, N f mv r sin \u2013 cos \u03b8 \u03b8 = 2 or we can say that in first case N sin \u03b8 and f cos \u03b8 are equal while in second case their difference is mv r 2 . This can occur in following three ways: (i) N increases while f remains same. (ii) N remains same while f decreases or (iii) N increases and f decreases. But only third case is possible, i.e. N will increase and f will decrease. This is because Eq. (ii), N f mg cos sin \u03b8 \u03b8 + = = constant is still has to be valid. So, to keep N f cos sin \u03b8 \u03b8 + to be constant N should increase and f should decrease (as\u03b8 = constant). Now, as speed goes on increasing, force of friction first decreases. Becomes zero at v rg = tan \u03b8 and then starts acting in downward direction, so that its horizontal component f cos \u03b8 with N sin \u03b8 now provides the required centripetal force. V Example 10.4 A small block of mass 100 g moves with uniform speed in a horizontal circular groove, with vertical side walls of radius 25 cm. If the block takes 2.0 s to complete one round, find the normal constant force by the side wall of the groove.

V Example 10.5 A fighter plane is pulling out for a dive at a speed of 900 km/h. Assuming its path to be a vertical circle of radius 2000 m and its mass to be 16000 kg, find the force exerted by the air on it at the lowest point. Take, g m s = 9.8 / 2. Solution At the lowest point in the path, the acceleration is vertically upward (towards the centre) and its magnitude is v r 2 / . The forces on the plane are : (a) weight Mg downward and (b) force F by the air upward. Hence, Newton's second law of motion gives F Mg Mv r \u2212 = 2 / or F M g v r = + ( / ) 2 Here, v = = \u00d7 = 900 9 10 3600 250 5 km/h m/s m/s \u2234 F = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \u00d7 16000 62500 2000 105 9.8 N 6.56 N (upward).

V Example 10.8 A turn of radius 20 m is banked for the vehicle of mass 200 kg going at a speed of 10 m/s. Find the direction and magnitude of frictional force acting on a vehicle if it moves with a speed (a) 5 m/s (b) 15 m/s. Assume that friction is sufficient to prevent slipping.

Using the equations \u03a3F mv r x = 2 and \u03a3Fy = 0,  we get N f mv r sin cos \u03b8 \u03b8 \u2212 = 2 \u2026(i) Chapter 10 Circular Motion \u0097 441 45\u00b0 a T l mg r Fig. 10.15 \u03b8 mg N \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 x y f Fig. 10.16  N f mg cos sin \u03b8 \u03b8 + = \u2026(ii) Substituting, \u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 tan , 1 1 2 v = 5 m/s, m = 200kg and r = 20 m, in the above equations, we get f = 300 5 N (upwards) (b) In the second case force of friction f will act downwards. Using \u03a3F mv r x = 2 and \u03a3Fy = 0, we get N f mv r sin cos \u03b8 \u03b8 + = 2 \u2026(iii) N f mg cos sin \u03b8 \u03b8 \u2212 = \u2026(iv) Substituting \u03b8 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 tan , 1 1 2 v = 15m/s, m = 200 kg and r = 20 min the above equations, we get f = 500 5 N (downwards) 1.

In non-inertial frames a pseudo force \u2212ma has to be applied. (a = acceleration of frame of reference). After applying the pseudo force one can apply Newton\u2019s laws in their usual form. Now, suppose a frame of reference is rotating with constant angular velocity \u03c9 in a circle of radius \u2018r\u2019. Then, it will become a non-inertial frame of acceleration r\u03c92 towards the centre. Now, if we observe an object of mass \u2018m\u2019 from this frame then a pseudo force of magnitude mr\u03c92 will have to be applied to this object in a direction away from the centre. This pseudo force is called the centrifugal force. After applying this force we can now apply Newton\u2019s laws in their usual form. Following examples will illustrate the concept more clearly: V Example 10.9 A particle of mass m is placed over a horizontal circular table rotating with an angular velocity \u03c9 about a vertical axis passing through its centre. The distance of the object from the axis is r. Find the force of friction f between the particle and the table. Solution Let us solve this problem from both frames. The one is a frame fixed on ground and the other is a frame fixed on table itself. From Frame of Reference Fixed on Ground (Inertial) Here, N will balance its weight and the force of friction f will provide the necessary centripetal force. Thus, f mr = \u03c92 Ans. From Frame of Reference Fixed on Table Itself (Non-inertial) In the free body diagram of particle with respect to table, in addition to above three forces (N, mg and f ) a pseudo force of magnitude mr\u03c92 will have to be applied in a direction away from the centre. But one thing should be clear that in this frame the particle is in equilibrium, i.e. N will balance its weight in vertical direction while f will balance the pseudo force in horizontal direction. or f mr = \u03c92 Ans. Thus, we see that f comes out to be mr\u03c92from both the frames.

Direction of FB is also radially outwards. 10.5 Motion in a Vertical Circle Suppose a particle of mass m is attached to an inextensible light string of length R. The particle is moving in a vertical circle of radius R about a fixed point O. It is imparted a velocity u in horizontal direction at lowest point A. Let v be its velocity at point B of the circle as shown in figure. Here, h R = \u2212 ( cos ) 1 \u03b8 \u2026(i) From conservation of mechanical energy 1 2 2 2 m u v mgh ( ) \u2212 = or v u gh 2 2 2 = \u2212 \u2026(ii) 444 \u0097 Mechanics - I O \u03b8 R B u v A h mg cos \u03b8 mg sin \u03b8 T Fig. 10.22 1m 1m A B \u03c9 = 2 m/s Fig. 10.21  The necessary centripetal force is provided by the resultant of tension T and mg cos \u03b8 \u2234 T mg mv R \u2212 = cos \u03b8 2 \u2026(iii) Now, following three conditions arise depending on the value of u. Condition of Looping the Loop (u gR \u2265 5 ) The particle will complete the circle if the string does not slack even at the highest point ( ) \u03b8 \u03c0 = . Thus, tension in the string should be greater than or equal to zero ( ) T \u22650 at \u03b8 \u03c0. = In critical case substituting T = 0 and \u03b8 \u03c0 = in Eq. (iii), we get mg mv R = min 2 or v gR min 2 = or v gR min = (at highest point) Substituting \u03b8 \u03c0 = in Eq. (i), h R = 2 Therefore, from Eq. (ii), we have u v gh min min 2 2 2 = + or u gR g R gR min 2 2 2 5 = + = ( ) or u gR min = 5 Thus, if u gR \u2265 5 , the particle will complete the circle. At u gR = 5 , velocity at highest point is v gR = and tension in the string is zero. Substituting\u03b8 = \u00b0 0 and v gR = 5 in Eq. (iii), we getT mg = 6 or in the critical condition tension in the string at lowest position is 6 mg. This is shown in Fig. 10.23. If u gR < 5 , following two cases are possible Condition of Leaving the Circle ( 2 5 ) gR u gR < < If u gR < 5 , the tension in the string will become zero before reaching the highest point. From Eq. (iii), tension in the string becomes zero ( ) T = 0 where, cos \u03b8 = \u2212v Rg 2 or cos \u03b8 = \u2212 2 2 gh u Rg Substituting this value of cos \u03b8 in Eq. (i), we get 2 1 2 gh u Rg h R \u2212 = \u2212 or h u Rg g h = + = 2 1 3 (say) \u2026(iv) or we can say that at height h1 tension in the string becomes zero. Further, if u gR < 5 , velocity of the particle becomes zero when 0 2 2 = \u2212 u gh or h u g h = = 2 2 2 (say) \u2026(v) i.e. at height h2 velocity of particle becomes zero. Chapter 10 Circular Motion \u0097 445 u A u gR min = 5 T mg = 6 O R v gR min = T = 0 P Fig. 10.23  Now, the particle will leave the circle if tension in the string becomes zero but velocity is not zero or T = 0 but v \u22600. This is possible only when h h 1 2 < or u Rg g u g 2 2 3 2 + < or 2 2 3 2 2 u Rg u + < or u Rg 2 2 > or u Rg > 2 Therefore, if 2 5 gR u gR < < , the particle leaves the circle. From Eq. (iv), we can see that h R > if u gR 2 2 > . Thus, the particle will leave the circle when h R > or 90 180 \u00b0 < < \u00b0 \u03b8 . This situation is shown in the Fig. 10.24. 2 5 gR u gR < < or 90 180 \u00b0 < < \u00b0 \u03b8 Note After leaving the circle, the particle will follow a parabolic path as the particle comes under gravity. Condition of Oscillation (0 2 < \u2264 u gR) The particle will oscillate, if velocity of the particle becomes zero but tension in the string is not zero. or v = 0, but T \u22600. This is possible when h h 2 1 < or u g u Rg g 2 2 2 3 < + or 3 2 2 2 2 u u Rg < + or u Rg 2 2 < or u Rg < 2 Moreover, if h h 1 2 = , u Rg = 2 and tension and velocity both becomes zero simultaneously. Further, from Eq. (iv), we can see that h R \u2264 if u Rg \u2264 2 . Thus, for0 2 < \u2264 u gR, particle oscillates in lower half of the circle ( ) 0 90 \u00b0 < \u2264 \u00b0 \u03b8 . This situation is shown in the figure. 0 2 < \u2264 u gR or 0 90 \u00b0 < \u2264 \u00b0 \u03b8 Note The above three conditions have been derived for a particle moving in a vertical circle attached to a string. The same conditions apply, if a particle moves inside a smooth spherical shell of radius R. The only difference is that the tension is replaced by the normal reaction N. 446 \u0097 Mechanics - I O \u03b8 R u A P T v = 0, 0 \u2260 h R > v Fig. 10.24 v T =0, 0 \u2260 h R \u2264 \u03b8 O R P u Fig. 10.25  Condition of Looping the Loop is u gR \u2265 5 Condition of Leaving the Circle is 2 5 gR u gR < < Condition of Oscillation is 0 2 < \u2264 u gR V Example 10.11 A stone tied to a string of length L is whirled in a vertical circle with the other end of the string at the centre.

In general, in any curvilinear motion direction of instantaneous velocity is tangential to the path, while acceleration may have any direction. If we resolve the acceleration in two normal directions, one parallel to velocity and another perpendicular to velocity, the first component isat while the other isan Thus, at = component of a along v = = \u22c5 a v cos \u03b8 a v = = dv dt d dt | | v = rate of change of speed and an = component of a perpendicular to v = a sin \u03b8 = \u2212 a at 2 2 = v R 2/ Here, v is the speed of particle at that instant and R is called the radius of curvature to the curvilinear path at that point. 2. Ina a t = cos \u03b8, if\u03b8 is acute,a t will be positive and speed will increase. If\u03b8 is obtusea t will be negative and speed will decrease. If \u03b8 is 90\u00b0, a t is zero and speed will remain constant. 3. If a particle of mass m is connected to a light rod and whirled in a vertical circle of radius R, then to complete the circle, the minimum velocity of the particle at the bottommost point is not 5 gR . Because in this case, velocity of the particle at the topmost point can be zero also. Using conservation of mechanical energy between points A and B as shown in figure (a), we get 1 2 2 2 m u v mgh ( ) \u2212 = or 1 2 2 2 mu mg R = ( ) (asv = 0) \u2234 u gR = 2 Therefore, the minimum value of u in this case is 2 gR . Same is the case when a particle is compelled to move inside a smooth vertical tube as shown in figure (b). 4. Oscillation of a pendulum is the part of a vertical circular motion. At point A and C since velocity is zero, net centripetal force will be zero. Only tangential force is present. From A and B or C to B speed of the bob increases. Therefore, tangential force is parallel to velocity. From B to A or B to C speed of the bob decreases. Hence, tangential force is antiparallel to velocity. 450 \u0097 Mechanics - I \u03b8 a v O R A B v = 0 h R = 2 u gR \u2265 \u221a 2 R u d d R < < u gR 2 \u2265 \u221a (a) (b) C B A  5. In circular motion, acceleration of the particle has two components (i) tangential acceleration a dv dt R t = = \u03b1 (ii) normal or radial acceleration a v R R n = = 2 2 \u03c9 at and an are two perpendicular components of a.

Therefore, at and ar both are there. In moving upwards, speed decreases. So, at is in opposite direction of velocity. In moving downwards, speed increases. So, at is in the direction of velocity. (ii) In circular motion normally, we resolve the forces in two directions, radial and tangential. Here only two forces act on the particle, tension (T) and weight ( ) mg . Tension is always in the radial direction (towards centre). So, resolve \u2018mg\u2019 along radial and tangential directions. (iii) Weight ( ) mg is a constant force, while tension (T) is variable.

Subjective Questions 2. The bridge method is better because it is the null point method which is superior to all other methods. 3. Because the graph in this case is a straight line. 4. In the case of second resonance, energy gets distributed over a larger region and as such second resonance becomes feebler. 5. The bridge becomes insensitive for too high or too low values and the readings become undependable. When determining low resistance, the end resistance of the meter bridge wire and resistance of connecting wires contribute towards the major part of error. 6. No, the resistance of the connecting wires is itself of the order of the resistance to be measured. It would create uncertainty in the measurement of low resistance. 7. 20 19 ",

At time t t = 1, slope of s t- graph ( ) = velocity is positive and increasing. Therefore velocity is positive and  acceleration is also positive. At time t t = 2, slope is negative but decreasing (in magnitude). Therefore velocity is negative but decreasing in magnitude. Hence, acceleration is positive. 16.

Between 2 to 4 s motion is uniform, so displacement-time graph will be a straight line. Between 6 to 8 s motion is decelerated hence displacement-time graph is again a parabola but inverted in shape. At the end of 8 s velocity is zero, therefore, slope of displacement-time graph should be zero. The corresponding graph is shown in above figure. 18.

Match the Columns 1. In (a) and (b), if velocity is in the direction of acceleration (or of the same sign as that of acceleration) then speed increases. And if velocity is in opposite direction, then speed decreases. In (c) slope of s t- graph (velocity) is increasing. Therefore speed is increasing. In (d) slope of s t- graph is decreasing. Therefore, speed is decreasing. 2. If v a \u22c5 = 0, speed is constant because angle between v and a in this case is 90\u00b0. If v a \u22c5 = positive then speed is increasing because angle between v and a in this case is acute. If v a \u22c5 = negative then speed is increasing because angle between v and a in this case is obtuse. Chapter 6 Kinematics \u0097 517 2 2 m 50 m 25 m/s 10 m/s2 1 10 m/s, 5 m/s2 + \u2013  3.

Therefore under all conditions T lies between m g 1 and m g 2 . 8. A frame moving with constant velocity ( ) a = 0 is inertial. 9. If vector sum of concurrent forces is zero, then all forces can be assumed a pair of two equal and opposite forces acting at one point. Now, if we take moment about any general point P, then moment of F1 is clockwise and moment of F2 (of same magnitude) is anti-clockwise. Therefore net moment is zero. 10.

With this value of \u03b8 we can also find that minimum value of force required from Eq. (i). 11. Friction (or you can say net force on man from ground) is in the direction of motion.

Direction of acceleration keeps on changing. So, it is variable accelration. Further, it is accelerated so it is non-inertial. 4. In first figure, v a \u22c5 = 0 In second figure, v a \u22c5 = positive and In third figure, v a \u22c5 = negative Further, \u03c9 and v are always perpendicular, so \u03c9 \u22c5 = v 0 5.
