The graph as shown is discontinuous at x = 1 , 2 and 3. 4.0 TYPES OF DISCONTINUITIES Type-1 \u2013 (Removable type of discontinuities) \u2013 In case Lim f x x a \u00ae ( ) exists but is not equal to f(a) then the function is said to have a removable discontinuity or discontinuity of the first kind. In this case we can redefine the function such that Lim x a \u00ae = f x f a ( ) b g  & make it continuous at x = a. Removable type of discontinuity can be further classified as: (a) Missing point discontinuity \u2013 Where Lim x a \u00ae f x( ) exists but  f(a) is not defined.

Such a discontinuity is known as non-removable discontinuity or discontinuity of the 2nd kind. Non-removable type of discontinuity can be further classified as : (a) Finite type discontinuity \u2013 In such type of discontinuity left hand limit and right hand limit at a point exists but are not equal. (b) Infinite type discontinuity \u2013 In such type of discontinuity atleast one of the limit viz. LHL and RHL is tending to infinity.

If the function f(x) and g(x) are differentiable in certain neighbourhood of the point 'a', except, may be, at the point 'a' itself and g'(x) \u00b9 0, and if x a x a lim f(x) lim g(x) 0 \u00ae \u00ae = =   or  x a x a lim f(x) lim g(x) \u00ae \u00ae = = \u00a5 , then x a x a f(x) f'(x) lim lim g(x) g'(x) \u00ae \u00ae = provided the limit x a f'(x) lim g'(x) \u00ae exists (L' H\u00f4pital's rule). The point 'a' may be either finite or improper (+ \u00a5 or \u2013\u00a5). (B) Indeterminate forms of the type 0. \u00a5 or \u00a5 \u2013 \u00a5 are reduced to forms of the type 0 0  or \u00a5 \u00a5  by algebraic transformations.

Interesting fact In 1694 John Bernoulli agreed to accept a retainer of 300 pounds per year from his former student L'H\u00f4pital to solve problems for him and keep him up to date on calculus. One of the problems was the so-called 0/0 problem, which Bernoulli solved as agreed. When L'H\u00f4pital published his notes on calculus in book form in 1696, the 0/ 0 rule appeared as a theorem. L'H\u00f4pital acknowledged his debt to Bernoulli and, to avoid claiming authorship of the book's entire contents, had the book published anonymously. Bernoulli nevertheless accused L'H\u00f4pital of plagiarism, an accusation inadvertently supported after L'H\u00f4pital's death in 1704 by the publisher's promotion of the book as L'H\u00f4pital's. By 1721, Bernoulli, a man so jealous he once threw his son Daniel out of the house for accepting a mathematics prize from the French Academy of Sciences, claimed to have been the author of the entire work. As puzzling and fickle as ever, history accepted Bernoulli's claim (until recently), but still named the rule after L'H\u00f4pital. 1.

PERMUTATION & COMBINATION 1.0 FUNDAMENTAL PRINCIPLE OF COUNTING (counting without actual counting) If an event A can occur in 'm' different ways and another event B can occur in 'n' different ways, then the total number of different ways of- (A) simultaneous occurrence of both events in a definite order is m\u00d7 n. This can be extended to any number of events (known as multiplication principle). (B) happening exactly one of the events is m + n (known as addition principle). Example \u2013 There are 15 IITs in India and let each IIT has 10 branches, then the IITJEE topper can select the IIT and branch in 15 \u00d7 10 = 150 number of ways. Example \u2013 There are 15 IITs  & 20 NITs in India, then a student who cleared both IITJEE & AIEEE exams can select an institute in (15 + 20) = 35 number of ways. Illustration 1.

(D) two particular students wish to be included together only ? (E) two particular students refuse to be together and two other particular students wish to be together only in the delegation ? Solution (A) Formation of delegation means selection of 4 out of 12. Hence the number of ways = 12C4 = 495. (B) If two particular students are already selected. Here we need to select only 2 out of the remaining 10. Hence the number of ways = 10C2 = 45. (C) The number of ways in which both are selected = 45. Hence the number of ways in which the two are not included together = 495 \u2013 45 = 450 (D) There are two possible cases (i) Either both are selected. In this case, the number of ways in which the selection can be made = 45. (ii) Or both are not selected. In this case all the four students are selected from the remaining ten students. This can be done in 10C4 = 210 ways. Hence the total number of ways of selection = 45 + 210 = 255 (E) We assume that students A and B wish to be selected together and students C and D do not wish to be together. Now there are following 6 cases. (i) (A, B, C) selected, (D) not selected (ii) (A, B, D) selected, (C) not selected (iii) (A, B) selected, (C, D) not selected (iv) (C)  selected, (A, B, D) not selected (v) (D)  selected, (A, B, C) not selected (vi) A, B, C, D  not selected For (i) the number of ways of selection = 8C1 = 8 For (ii) the number of ways of selection = 8C1 = 8 For (iii) the number of ways of selection = 8C2 = 28 For (iv) the number of ways of selection = 8C3 = 56 For (v) the number of ways of selection = 8C3 = 56 For (vi) the number of ways of selection = 8C4 = 70 Hence total number of ways = 8 + 8 + 28 + 56 + 56 + 70 = 226.

(E) In how many of these permutations, do the vowels and the consonants occupy the same relative positions as in HINDUSTAN ? Solution (A) The total number of permutations = Arrangements of nine letters taken all at a time = 9! 2! = 181440. (B) We have 3 vowels and 6 consonants, in which 2 consonants are alike. The first place can be filled in 3 ways and the last in 2 ways. The rest of the places can be filled in 7! 2!  ways. Hence the total number of permutations = 3 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 7! 2!  = 15120.

If all of them (A,B,C,D) are shifted by one place in anticlockwise order, then we will get Fig.(B) from Fig.(A). Now, if we shift A,B,C,D in anticlockwise order, we will get Fig.(C). Again, if we shift them, we will get Fig.(D) and in the next time, Fig.(A). Thus, we see that if 4 persons are sitting at a round table, they can be shifted four times and the four different arrangements, thus obtained will be the same, because anticlockwise order of A,B,C,D does not change. But if A,B,C,D are sitting in a row and they are shifted in such an order that the last occupies the place of first, then the four arrangements will be different. Thus, if there are 4 things, then for each circular arrangement number of linear arrangements is 4. Similarly, if n different things are arranged along a circle, for each circular arrangement number of linear arrangements is n. Therefore, the number of linear arrangements of n different things is n \u00d7 (number of circular arrangements of n different things). Hence, the number of circular arrangements of n different things is - 1/n \u00d7 (number of linear arrangements of n different things) = n! n = (n\u20131)! Therefore note that \u2013 (i) The number of circular permutations of n different things taken all at a time is : (n \u2013 1)!.

If it has exactly two divisors then it is called a prime. System of prime numbers begin with 2. All primes except 2 are odd. l A number having more than 2 divisors is called composite. 2 is the only even number which is not composite. l Two natural numbers are said to be relatively prime or coprime if their HCF is one. For two natural numbers to be relatively prime, it is not necessary that one or both should be prime. It is possible that they both are composite but still coprime, eg. 4 and 25. l 1 is neither prime nor composite however it is co-prime with every other natural number. l Two prime numbers are said to be twin prime numbers if their non-negative difference is 2 (e.g.5 & 7, 19 & 17 etc). l  All divisors except 1 and the number itself are called proper divisors.
