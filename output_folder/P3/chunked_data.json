This point is called the centre of mass (COM) of the system. The concept of COM is very useful in solving many problems, in particular, those concerned with collision of particles. Position of Centre of Mass First of all we find the position of COM of a system of particles. Just to make the subject easy we classify a system of particles in three groups: 1. System of two particles. 2. System of a large number of particles and 3. Continuous bodies. Now, let us take them separately. Position of COM of Two Particles Centre of mass of two particles of mass m1 and m2 separated by a distance of d lies in between the two particles. The distance of centre of mass from any of the particle ( )r is inversely proportional to the mass of the particle ( ) m . i.e. r m \u221d1 or r r m m 1 2 2 1 = or m r m r 1 1 2 2 = or r m m m d 1 2 2 1 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 and r m m m d 2 1 1 2 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 Here, r m 1 1 = distance of COM from and r m 2 2 = distance of COM from From the above discussion, we see that r r d 1 2 2 = = if m m 1 2 = , i.e. COM lies midway between the two particles of equal masses. Similarly, r r 1 2 > if m m 1 2 < and r r 1 2 < if m m 1 2 > , i.e. COM is nearer to the particle having larger mass. 2 \u0097 Mechanics - II m1 m2 ",

Suppose x, y and z are the co-ordinates of a small element of mass dm, we write the co-ordinates of COM as x x dm dm x dm M COM = = \u222b \u222b \u222b y y dm dm y dm M COM = = \u222b \u222b \u222b and z z dm dm z dm M COM = = \u222b \u222b \u222b Here, dm is the mass of small element and ( , , ) x y z co-ordinates of COM of this element. Note In most of the cases element is a particle. In this case, COM of this particle lies over the particle itself. Let us take an example. Centre of Mass of a Uniform Rod Suppose a rod of mass M and length L is lying along the x-axis with its one end at x = 0and the other at x L = . Mass per unit length of the rod = M L Hence, the mass of the element PQ of length dx situated at x x = is dm M L dx = The coordinates of the element PQ are ( , , ) x 0 0 . Therefore, x-coordinate of COM of the rod will be x x dm dm L COM = \u222b \u222b 0 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u222b0 L x M L dx M ( ) = \u222b 1 0 L x dx L = L 2 The y-coordinate of COM is y y dm dm COM = = \u222b \u222b 0 (as y = 0) Similarly, zCOM = 0 i.e. the coordinates of COM of the rod are L 2 0 0 , , . \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7Or it lies at the centre of the rod. Chapter 11 Centre of Mass, Linear Momentum and Collision \u0097 5 x = L x = 0 dx P Q Fig. 11.5  Proceeding in the similar manner, we can find the COM of certain rigid bodies. Centre of mass of some well known rigid bodies are given below : 1. Centre of mass of a uniform rectangular, square or circular plate  lies at its centre. 2. Centre of mass of a uniform semicircular ring lies at a distance of h R = 2 \u03c0 from its centre, on the axis of symmetry where R is the radius of the ring. 3. Centre of mass of a uniform semicircular disc of radius R lies at a distance of h R = 4 3\u03c0 from the centre on the axis of symmetry as shown in Fig. 11.8. 4. Centre of mass of a hemispherical shell of radius R lies at a distance of h R = 2 from its centre on the axis of symmetry as shown in figure 11.9. 5. Centre of mass of a solid hemisphere of radius R lies at a distance of h R = 3 8 from its centre on the axis of symmetry. V Example 11.4 A rod of length L is placed along the x-axis between x = 0 and x L = . The linear mass density (mass/length) \u03c1 of the rod varies with the distance x from the origin as \u03c1 = + a bx. Here, a and b are constants.

It is assumed that no mass enters or leaves the system during its motion, so that M remains constant. Then, as we have seen in the above article, we have the relation r r r r COM = + + + + + + m m m m m m n n n 1 1 2 2 1 2 K K = + + + m m m M n n 1 1 2 2 r r r K or M m m mn n r r r r COM = + + + 1 1 2 2 K Differentiating this expression with respect to time t, we have M d dt m d dt m d dt m d dt n n r r r r COM = + + + 1 1 2 2 K Since, d dt r = velocity Therefore, M m m mn n v v v v COM = + + + 1 1 2 2 K \u2026(i) or velocity of the COM is v v v v COM = + + + m m m M n n 1 1 2 2 ... or v v COM = =\u03a3 i n i i m M 1 Further, mv = momentum of a particle p.Therefore, Eq.

They cannot answer even the basic problems of COM. For example, let us take a simple problem: two particles one of mass 1 kg and the other of 2 kg are projected simultaneously with the same speed from the roof of a tower, the one of mass 1 kg vertically upwards and the other vertically downwards. What is the acceleration of centre of mass of these two particles? When I ask this question in my first class of centre of mass, three answers normally come from the students g g , 3 and zero.

So, p v = m The magnitude of linear momentum may be written as p mv = or p m v m mv mK 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= Thus, p Km = 2 or K p m = 2 2 Here, K is the kinetic energy of the particle. In accordance with Newton\u2019s second law, F a v v p = = = = m m d dt d m dt d dt ( ) Thus, F p = d dt In case the external force applied to a particle (or a body) be zero, we have F p = = d dt 0 or p = constant showing that in the absence of an external force, the linear momentum of a particle (or the body) remains constant. This is called the law of conservation of linear momentum. The law may be extended to a system of particles or to the centre of mass of a system of particles. For example, for a system of particles it takes the form : If net force (or the vector sum of all the forces) on a system of particles is zero, the vector sum of linear momentum of all the particles remain conserved, or If F F F F F = + + + + = 1 2 3 0 ... n Then, p p p p 1 2 3 + + + + = ... n constant The same is the case for the centre of mass of a system of particles, i.e. if FCOM =0, pCOM constant. = Thus, the law of conservation of linear momentum can be applied to a single particle, to a system of particles or even to the centre of mass of the particles. The law of conservation of linear momentum enables us to solve a number of problems which can not be solved by a straight application of the relation F a = m . For example, suppose a particle of mass m initially at rest, suddenly explodes into two fragments of masses m1 and m2 which fly apart with velocities v1 and v 2 respectively. Obviously, the forces resulting in the explosion of the particle must be internal forces, since no external force has been applied. In the absence of the external forces, therefore, the momentum must remain conserved and we should have m m m iv v v = + 1 1 2 2 Chapter 11 Centre of Mass, Linear Momentum and Collision \u0097 15  Extra Points to Remember Since, the particle was initially at rest, v i = 0 and therefore, m m 1 1 2 2 0 v v + = v v 1 2 1 2 = \u2212m m or | | | | v v 1 2 2 1 = m m Showing at once that the velocities of the two fragments must be inversely proportional to their masses and in opposite directions along the same line. This result could not possibly be arrived at from the relation F a = m , since we know nothing about the forces that were acting during the explosion. Nor, could we derive it from the law of conservation of energy. \u0098 If law of conservation of linear momentum is applied to a single particle, then we can explain it like this. If net force or net external force (as there is no internal force on a single particle) acting on the particle is zero then its linear momentum remains constant. If mass of the particle is constant, then velocity of the particle is also constant. If the particle is at rest then it will remain at rest for ever. If it is moving then it will continue to be moving with constant velocity. \u0098 If law of conservation of momentum is applied to a system of particles (may be a rigid body also) then the law is like this : It net force or net external force (as summation of net internal forces acting on a system of particles is already zero) on a system of particles (or on the centre of mass of the system of particles) is zero, then total momentum of the system of particles (or momentum of centre of mass of the system of particles) remains constant. If total mass of the system of particles is constant then velocity of centre of mass will also remain constant. \u0098 If a projectile explodes in air in different parts, the path of the centre of mass remains unchanged. This is because during explosion no external force (except gravity) acts on the centre of mass. The situation is as shown in figure. Path of COM is parabola, even though the different parts travel in different directions after explosion. This situation continues till the first particle strikes the ground. Because, after that force behaviour of system of particles will change. V Example 11.9 Linear momentum of particle is increased by (a) 100 % (b) 1 % without changing its mass. Find percentage increase in its kinetic energy in both cases.

Plus sign indicates that, with increase in linear momentum, kinetic energy will also increase. (b) K p m = 2 2 or K p \u221d 2 (as m= constant) Here, power of K is 1 and power of p is 2. For small changes, we can  write it like this (1) (% change in K) = ( ) 2 (% change in p) or % change in K = ( )( %) 2 1 = + 2% Ans.

We now consider those systems whose mass is variable, i.e. those in which mass enters or leaves the system. A typical case is that of the rocket from which hot gases keep on escaping, thereby continuously decreasing its mass. In such problems you have nothing to do but apply a thrust force ( ) Ft to the main mass in addition to the all other forces acting on it. This thrust force is given by, F v t dm dt = \u00b1 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 rel Here, v rel is the velocity of the mass gained or mass ejected relative to the main mass. In case of rocket this is sometimes called the exhaust velocity of the gases. dm dt is the rate at which mass is increasing or decreasing. The expression for the thrust force can be derived from the conservation of linear momentum in the absence of any external forces on a system as follows : Suppose at some moment mass of a body is m and its velocity is v. After some time interval dt its mass becomes ( ) m dm \u2212 and velocity becomes v v + d . The mass dm is ejected with relative velocity v r . Absolute velocity of mass \u2018 \u2019 dm is therefore ( ) v v v r d + + .

Make a list of all the forces acting on the main mass and apply these forces on it. 2. Apply an additional thrust force Ft on the mass, the magnitude of which is v r dm dt \u00b1 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \uf8e6 \uf8e6 \uf8e6 \uf8e6 \uf8e6 \uf8e6and direction is given by the direction of v r in case the mass is increasing and in the direction of \u2212v r if it is decreasing. 3. Find net force on the mass and apply F v net = m d dt (m = mass at that particular instant) Rocket Propulsion Let m0 be the mass of the rocket at time t = 0.m its mass at any time t and v its velocity at that moment. Initially let us assume that the velocity of the rocket is u. Further, let \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 dm dt be the mass of the gas ejected per unit time and vr the exhaust velocity of the gases. Usually \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 dm dt and vr are kept constant throughout the journey of the rocket.

A rocket of mass 20 kg has 180 kg fuel. The exhaust velocity of the fuel is 1.6 km/s. Calculate the minimum rate of consumption of fuel so that the rocket may rise from the ground. Also, calculate the ultimate vertical speed gained by the rocket when the rate of consumption of fuel is ( ) g =9.8 m/s2 (i) 2 kg/s (ii) 20 kg/s 2. A rocket, with an initial mass of 1000 kg, is launched vertically upwards from rest under gravity. The rocket burns fuel at the rate of 10 kg per second. The burnt matter is ejected vertically downwards with a speed of2000 1 ms\u2212relative to the rocket. If burning ceases after one minute, find the maximum velocity of the rocket. (Take g as constant at 10 2 ms\u2212) 3. A rocket is moving vertically upward against gravity. Its mass at time t is m m t = \u2212 0 \u00b5 and it expels burnt fuel at a speed u vertically downward relative to the rocket. Derive the equation of motion of the rocket but do not solve it. Here, \u00b5 is constant. 4. A rocket of initial mass m0 has a mass m t 0 1 3 ( / ) \u2212 at time t. The rocket is launched from rest vertically upwards under gravity and expels burnt fuel at a speed u relative to the rocket vertically downward. Find the speed of rocket att = 1. Chapter 11 Centre of Mass, Linear Momentum and Collision \u0097 23 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 11.4  11.5 Linear Impulse Consider a constant force F which acts for a time t on a body of mass m, thus, changing its velocity from u to v. Because the force is constant, the body will travel with constant acceleration a where F a = m and a v u t = \u2212 hence, F v u m t = \u2212 or F v u t m m = \u2212 The product of constant force F and the time t for which it acts is called the impulse ( ) J of the force and this is equal to the change in linear momentum which it produces. Thus, Impulse = ( ) J F p p p t f i = = \u2212 \u2206 Instantaneous Impulse There are many occasions when a force acts for such a short time that the effect is instantaneous, e.g. a bat striking a ball. In such cases, although the magnitude of the force and the time for which it acts may each be unknown but the value of their product (i.e., impulse) can be known by measuring the initial and final momenta. Thus, we can write J F p p p = = = \u2212 \u222b dt f i \u2206 Regarding the impulse it is important to note that impulse applied to an object in a given time interval can also be calculated from the area under force-time (F-t) graph in the same time interval. In one dimensional motion, we can simply write as, J F dt p p p f i = = = \u2212 \u222b \u2206 In this equation all vector quantities (J, F and p) are taken with proper signs. Further, if mass is constant, then we can write, p p f i \u2212 as m v v f i ( ) \u2212 Now depending on the nature of force there are following three cases : Case 1 If force is constant, then linear impulse can be obtained by multiplying this constant force with the given time interval. Now, this impulse is change in linear momentum. Case 2 If force is a function of time, then linear impulse can be obtained by integrating this linear function of time in the given time interval. Result of this integration (or linear impulse) is equal to the change in linear momentum. Case 3 If force versus time graph is given, then linear impulse can be obtained by the area under F-t graph. This area (or the linear impulse) is equal to the change in linear momentum. Note Normally, the word impulse is used when a large force acts for a short interval of time but the equations discussed above can be used even if the time interval is large. 24 \u0097 Mechanics - II  V Example 11.15 A ball of mass 200 g is projected with a velocity of 30 m/s at 30\u00b0 from horizontal. Using the concept of impulse, find change in velocity in 2 s. Take g m s =10 2 / . Solution In air, a constant force (= weight = mg) will act on the ball. Therefore, the linear impulse can be obtained directly by multiplying this constant force with the given time interval. Further, this linear impulse is equal to the change in linear momentum. Thus, J F v = \u00d7 = = t m \u2206 \u2206 p \u21d2 \u2206v F g = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 t m t m m = \u00d7 = g t ( )( ) 10m/s downwards 2 s 2 = 20m/s (downwards) Ans. V Example 11.16 A time varying force, F t =2 is acting on a particle of mass 2 kg moving along x-axis. velocity of the particle is 4 m s/ along negative x-axis at time t=0. Find the velocity of the particle at the end of 4 s. Solution Given force is a function of time. So, linear impulse can be obtained by integration.  Further, this impulse is equal to change in linear momentum. Thus, J F dt p p p m v v f i f i = = = \u2212 = \u2212 \u222b \u2206 ( ) or v m F dt v f i = + \u222b 1 = \u2212 \u222b 1 2 2 4 0 4 ( )t dt (vi = \u22124 m/s) = \u2212 1 2 4 2 0 4 [ ] t = \u2212 \u2212 1 2 16 0 4 [ ] = + 4 m/s Ans. Therefore, the final velocity is 4 m/s along positive x-direction. V Example 11.17 A particle of mass 2 kg is initially at rest. A force starts acting on it in one direction whose magnitude changes with time. The force time graph is shown in figure. Find the velocity of the particle at the end of 10 s.

(ii) the total momentum of the particles remain conserved. The collision is in fact a redistribution of total momentum of the particles. Thus, law of conservation of linear momentum is indispensable in dealing with the phenomenon of collision between particles. Consider a situation shown in figure. Two blocks of masses m1 and m2 are moving with velocities v1 and v v 2 1 ( ) < along the same straight line in a smooth horizontal surface. A spring is attached to the block of mass m2. Now, let us see what happens during the collision between two particles. Figure (a) Block of mass m1 is behind m2. Since, v v 1 2 > , the blocks will collide after some time. Figure (b) The spring is compressed. The spring force F kx ( ) = acts on the two blocks in the directions shown in figure. This force decreases the velocity of m1 and increases the velocity of m2. Figure (c) The spring will compress till velocity of both the blocks become equal. So, at maximum compression (say xm) velocities of both the blocks are equal (say v). Figure (d) Spring force is still in the directions shown in figure, i.e. velocity of block m1 is further decreased and that of m2 is increased. The spring now starts relaxing. Figure (e) The two blocks are separated from one another. Velocity of block m2 becomes more than the velocity of block m1, i.e. v v 2 1 \u2032 > \u2032 . Equations Which can be Used in the Above Situation Assuming spring to be perfectly elastic following two equations can be applied in the above situation. (i) In the absence of any external force on the system the linear momentum of the system will remain conserved before, during and after collision, i.e. m v m v m m v m v m v 1 1 2 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 + = + = \u2032 + \u2032 ( ) \u2026(i) Chapter 11 Centre of Mass, Linear Momentum and Collision \u0097 27 v1 ' (e) v v 1 < 2 ' ' v2 ' m1 m2 F F (d) m1 m2 m1 v1 v2 v v 1 > 2 (a) m2 F F (b) m1 m2 v v Maximum compression =xm (c) m1 m2 Fig. 11.32  (ii) In the absence of any dissipative forces, the mechanical energy of the system will also remain conserved, i.e. 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 2 2 2 m v m v m m v kxm + = + + ( ) = \u2032 + \u2032 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 m v m v \u2026(ii) Note In the above situation we have assumed, spring to be perfectly elastic, i.e. it regains its original shape and size after the two blocks are separated. In actual practice there is no such spring between the two blocks. During collision, both the blocks (or bodies) are slightly deformed. This situation is similar to the compression of the spring. Due to deformation, two equal and opposite forces act on both the blocks. These two forces redistribute their linear momentum in such a manner that both the blocks are separated from one another. The collision is said to be elastic if both the blocks regain their original shape and size completely after they are separated. On the other hand if the blocks do not return to their original form the collision is said to be inelastic. If the deformation is permanent and the blocks move together with same velocity after the collision, the collision is said to be perfectly inelastic. Types of Collision Collision between two bodies may be classified in two ways: 1. Elastic collision and inelastic collision. 2. Head on collision or oblique collision. As discussed earlier also collision between two bodies is said to be elastic if both the bodies come to their original shape and size after the collision, i.e. no fraction of mechanical energy remains stored as deformation potential energy in the bodies. Thus in addition to the linear momentum, kinetic energy also remains conserved before and after collision. On the other hand, in an inelastic collision, the colliding bodies do not return to their original shape and size completely after collision and some part of the mechanical energy of the system goes to the deformation potential energy. Thus, only linear momentum remains conserved in case of an inelastic collision. Further, a collision is said to be head on (or direct) if the directions of the velocity of colliding objects are along the line of action of the impulses, acting at the instant of collision. If just before collision, at least one of the colliding objects was moving in a direction different from the line of action of the impulses, the collision is called oblique or indirect. Head on Elastic Collision Let the two balls of masses m1and m2 collide each other elastically with velocities v1 and v2 in the directions shown in Fig. 11.33(a). Their velocities become v1 \u2032 and v2 \u2032 after the collision along the same line. Applying conservation of linear momentum, we get m v m v m v m v 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 + = \u2032 + \u2032 \u2026(iii) 28 \u0097 Mechanics - II m2 m1 v2 v1 (a) Before collision m2 m1 v2 ' (b) After collision v1 ' Fig. 11.33  In an elastic collision kinetic energy before  and after collision is also conserved. Hence, 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 1 1 2 2 2 2 m v m v m v m v + = \u2032 + \u2032 \u2026(iv) Solving Eqs. (iii) and (iv) for v1 \u2032 and v2 \u2032, we get v m m m m v m m m v 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 2 \u2032 = \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 + + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2026(v) and v m m m m v m m m v 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 1 2 \u2032 = \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 + + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2026(vi) Special Cases 1. If m m 1 2 = , then from Eqs. (v) and (vi), we can see that v v 1 2 \u2032 = and v v 2 1 \u2032 = i.e. when two particles of equal mass collide elastically and the collision is head on, they exchange their velocities., e.g. 2. If m m 1 2 > > and v1 0 = . Then m m 2 1 0 \u2248 with these two substitutions v m m 1 2 1 0 0 = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 and we get the following two results v1 0 \u2032 \u2248 and v v 2 2 \u2032 \u2248\u2212 i.e. the particle of mass m1 remains at rest while the particle of mass m2 bounces back with same speed v2. 3.

Note It is important to note that Eqs. (v) and (vi) and their three special cases can be used only in case of a head on elastic collision between two particles. I have found that many students apply these two equations even if the collision is inelastic and do not apply these relations where clearly a head on elastic collision is given in the problem. Head on Inelastic Collision As we have discussed earlier also, in an inelastic collision, the particles do not regain their shape and size completely after collision. Some fraction of mechanical energy is retained by the colliding particles in the form of deformation potential energy. Thus, the kinetic energy of the particles no longer remains conserved. However, in the absence of external forces, law of conservation of linear momentum still holds good. Suppose the velocities of two particles of mass m1 and m2 before collision be v1 and v2 in the directions shown in figure. Let v1 \u2032 and v2 \u2032 be their velocities after collision. The law of conservation of linear momentum gives m v m v m v m v 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 + = \u2032 + \u2032 \u2026(vii) Collision is said to be perfectly inelastic if both the particles stick together after collision and move with same velocity, say v\u2032 as shown in Fig. 11.38. In this case, Eq. (vii) can be written as m v m v m m v 1 1 2 2 1 2 + = + \u2032 ( ) or v m v m v m m \u2032 = + + 1 1 2 2 1 2 \u2026(viii) Newton's Law of Restitution When two objects are in direct (head on) impact, the speed with which they separate after impact is usually less than or equal to their speed of approach before impact. Experimental evidence suggests that the ratio of these relative speeds is constant for two given set of objects. This property formulated by Newton, is known as the law of restitution and can be written in the form separation speed approach speed = e \u2026(ix) The ratio e is called the coefficient of restitution and is constant for two particular objects.

So, their separation speed is zero or e = 0 from Eq. (ix). e =1, for an elastic collision, as we can show from Eq. (v) and (vi), that v v v v 1 2 2 1 \u2032 \u2212 \u2032 = \u2212 or separation speed approach speed = or e =1 Let us now find the velocities of two particles after collision if they collide directly and the coefficient of restitution between them is given as e. Applying conservation of linear momentum m v m v m v m v 1 1 2 2 1 1 2 2 + = \u2032 + \u2032 \u2026(x) Further, separation speed (approach speed) = e or v v e v v 1 2 2 1 \u2032 \u2212 \u2032 = \u2212 ( ) \u2026(xi) Solving Eqs. (x) and (xi), we get v m em m m v m em m m 1 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 2 \u2032 = \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 + + + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7v2 \u2026(xii) and v m em m m v m em m m 2 2 1 1 2 2 1 1 1 2 \u2032 = \u2212 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 + + + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7v1 \u2026(xiii) Special Cases 1.

If just before impact at least one of the objects was moving in a direction different from the line of action of these impulses the collision is said to be oblique. In the figure, two balls collide obliquely. During collision impulses act in the direction xx. Henceforth, we will call this direction as common normal direction and a direction perpendicular to it (i.e. yy) as common tangent. Following four points are important regarding an oblique collision : 1. A pair of equal and opposite impulses act along common normal direction. Hence, linear momentum of individual bodies do change along common normal direction. If mass of the colliding bodies remain constant during collision, then we can say that linear velocity of the individual bodies change during collision in this direction. 2. No component of impulse act along common tangent direction. Hence, linear momentum or linear velocity of individual bodies (if mass is constant) remain unchanged along this direction. 3. Net impulse on both the bodies is zero during collision. Hence, net momentum of both the bodies remain conserved before and after collision in any direction. 4. Definition of coefficient of restitution can be applied along common normal direction, i.e. along common normal direction we can apply Relative speed of separation = (relative speed of approac e h) Here, e is the coefficient of restitution between the particles. 32 \u0097 Mechanics - II m1 m2 v2 Before collision v = 0 1 v2 ' After collision v1 ' Fig. 11.40 x y x v y Fig. 11.42 v gh 0 = 2 \u221a h u = 0 Fig. 11.41  V Example 11.19 Two blocks A and B of equal mass m kg = 1.0 are lying on a smooth horizontal surface as shown in figure.

Centre of mass frame of reference or C-frame of reference or zero momentum frame A frame of reference carried by the centre of mass of an isolated system of particles (i.e. a system not subjected to any external forces) is called the centre of mass or C-frame of reference. In this frame of reference. (i)  Position vector of centre of mass is zero. (ii) Velocity and hence momentum of centre of mass is also zero. 2. A liquid of density \u03c1 is filled in a container as shown in figure. The liquid comes out from the container through a orifice of area \u2018a\u2019 at a depth \u2018h\u2019 below the free surface of the liquid with a velocity v. This exerts a thrust force in the container in the backward direction. This thrust force is given by F v dm dt t r = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 Here, v v r = (in forward direction) and \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= dm dt av \u03c1 as dV dt \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= Volume of liquid flowing per second = av \u2234 \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= dm dt dV dt av \u03c1 \u03c1 \u2234 F v av t = ( ) \u03c1 or F av t = \u03c1 2 (in backward direction) Further, we will see in the chapter of fluid mechanics that v gh = 2 . 3. Suppose, a chain of mass per unit length \u03bb begins to fall through a hole in the ceiling as shown in Fig. (a) or the end of the chain piled on the platform is lifted vertically as in Fig. (b). In both the cases, due to increase of mass in the portion of the chain which is moving with a velocity v at certain moment of time a thrust force acts on this part of the chain which is given by Chapter 11 Centre of Mass, Linear Momentum and Collision \u0097 39 (a) (b) v Ft h  F v dm dt t r = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7.. Here, v v r = and dm dt v = \u03bb Here, vr is upwards in case (a) and downwards in case (b). Thus, F v t = \u03bb 2 The direction of Ft is upwards in case (a) and downwards in case (b). 4.

Thrust force in variable mass system is nothing but a result of law of conservation of linear momentum. Let us take an example. A boy is standing over a trolley kept over a smooth surface. If the boy throws a stone towards right, then mass of (trolley + boy) system is decreasing. Relative velocity of stone is towards right. So, a thrust force will act on (trolley + boy) system towards left (in a direction opposite to relative velocity, as mass is decreasing). Due to this thrust force (trolley + boy) system will move towards left. And this is nothing but law of conservation of linear momentum. Initial momentum of system was zero. Therefore final momentum should also be zero. If momentum of stone is towards right, then momentum of (trolley + boy) system should be towards left (of same magnitude), to make total momentum equal to zero. 7. In perfectly inelastic collision, all bodies stick together and they have a common velocity given by: vcommon Total momentum Total mass = = pTotal Total M and this common velocity is also equal to the velocity of centre of mass of the system.

Therefore, total momentum of the system at any instant or pf is also zero. (iv) Since, we are using only one conservation law i.e. law of conservation of linear momentum, so we have only one equation and only one unknown. V Example 1 A trolley of mass M is at rest over a smooth horizontal surface as shown in figure. Two boys each of mass \u2018m\u2019 are standing over the trolley. They jump from the trolley (towards right) with relative velocity vr [relative to velocity of trolley just after jumping] (a) together (b) one after the other. Find velocity of trolley in both cases. Solution (a) Let velocity of trolley just after jumping is v1 (towards left). Relative velocity of boys towards right is vr. Therefore, there absolute velocity is v v r \u2212 1, towards right.

Two stuntmen of mass \u2018m\u2019 each are also moving with the trains (at rest w.r.t. trains). When trains are opposite to each other the stuntmen interchange their positions, then find the final velocities of the trains.

Now, (A) will fall over (D). So this is one system and suppose velocity of this system is V1 (towards right or in positive direction) after jumping. Similarly, (C) will fall over (B) after jumping.

Find the maximum height 'h\u2019 attained by \u2018m\u2019 (over the wedge or outside it). Solution At maximum height vertical component of velocity of \u2018m\u2019 will be zero. It will have only horizontal component of velocity and this is equal to the horizontal component of \u2018M\u2019 also (think why ?). So at the highest point figure is like this: Applying law of conservation of linear momentum in horizontal direction, p p i f = \u21d2 mv M m v 0 = + ( ) \u2026(i) Now, applying law of conservation of mechanical energy, E E i f = \u2234 1 2 1 2 0 2 2 mv M m v mgh = + + ( ) \u2026(ii) We have two unknowns v and h.

Concept If net force on a system in a particular direction is zero (normally in horizontal direction). And this can done by giving the ground smooth. Initially, the system is at rest. So, in this case individual bodies can move towards right or towards left, but centre of mass will remain stationary. Further, net force in horizontal direction is zero. Hence, total force towards right is equal to the total force towards left or, \u03a3 \u03a3 F F R L = \u2026(i) or \u03a3 \u03a3 m a m a R R L L = \u2026(ii) Now, integrating \u2018a\u2019 we will get \u2018v\u2019 and by further integrating \u2018v\u2019, we will get \u2018x\u2019. \u2234 \u03a3 \u03a3 m v m v R R L L = \u2026(iii) and \u03a3 \u03a3 m x m x R R L L = \u2026(iv) Note If the system is initially not at rest but net force is zero, then Eqs.

Find the displacement of the plank over the floor when the man reaches the other end of the plank. Solution Here, the system is man + plank.

Let x be the displacement of the Plank. Assuming the origin, i.e. x = 0 at the position shown in figure. As we said earlier also, the centre of mass will not move in horizontal direction (x-axis).

Solution Absolute velocity of man = \u2212 v v r where v = recoil velocity of platform. Taking the platform and the man as a system, net external force on the system in horizontal direction is zero.

Concept If a bomb or a projectile explodes in two or more than two parts, then it explodes due to internal forces. Therefore, net force or net external force is zero. Hence, linear momentum of the system can be conserved just before and just after explosion. By this momentum conservation equation, we can find the velocity of some unknown part. If explosion takes place in air, then during the explosion, the external force due to gravity (= weight) can be neglected, as the time of explosion is very short. So, impulse of this force is negligible and impulse is change in linear momentum.Hence, change in linear momentum is also negligible.

Concept In case of a variable mass system, a thrust force of magnitude v dm dt r \u00d7 has to be applied on the system, whose mass is changing. Direction of this force is in the direction of v r if mass is increasing and in the opposite direction of v r, if mass is decreasing, Further, v r is zero if a mass is just dropped from a moving body. Because the dropped body has the same velocity as of the moving body at the time of dropping. So, no thrust force will act in this case. V Example 10 A constant force F is applied on a trolley of initial mass m0 kept over a smooth surface. Sand is poured gently over the trolley at a constant rate of ( ) / \u00b5 kg s. After time t, find (a) mass of the trolley (with sand) (b) net force on the trolley (c) velocity of trolley Solution (a) Mass of the trolley after time t is m = mass of trolley + (mass of sand poured per second) (time) = + m t 0 \u00b5 (b) Let v is the velocity of trolley at time t. Sand is poured gently. So, velocity of sand is zero or, relative velocity of sand is v in the opposite direction of velocity of trolley. Mass of trolley is increasing. So, thrust force on the trolley is in the direction of relative velocity or in the opposite direction of motion of trolley. 50 \u0097 Mechanics - II F Smooth v F v v r = Thrust force = Ft  Net force on trolley = \u2212 F Ft = \u2212 F v dm dt r = \u2212 F v ( ) ( ) \u00b5 or F F v net = \u2212\u00b5 Ans.

Sand kept inside the trolley drains out from its floor at a constant rate of ( ) / \u00b5 kg s. After time t find: (a) total mass of trolley and sand. (b) net force on the trolley. (c) velocity of trolley. Solution (a) Total mass of trolley and sand m = initial mass \u2212mass of sand drained out or m m t = \u2212 0 \u00b5 (b) Let v is the velocity of trolley at time t.

Concept (i) During collision, equal and opposite impulses act on the two colliding bodies along common normal directions. This impulse changes the linear momentum of an individual body, but total momentum of the system remains constant, as the total linear impulse is zero. Further, this linear impulse is equal to change in linear momentum. (ii) Coefficient of restitution between two colliding bodies is defined along common normal direction and this is given by: e = relative speed of separation relative speed of approach V Example 12 Two balls of masses m and 2m and momenta 4p and 2p (in the directions shown) collide as shown in figure.

Based on conservation of linear momentum and vertical circular motion. Concept A ball of mass M is suspended from a massless string of length l as shown in figure. A bullet of mass m moving with velocity v0 collides with the ball and sticks with the ball. Now, velocity of the combined mass ( ) M m + just after collision at the bottommost point (say it's u) can by obtained from law of conservation of linear momentum. After finding the value of u we can use the theory of vertical circular motion. For example, if u gl \u2265 5 , then the combined mass will complete the vertical circular motion. If 2 5 gl u gl < < , string will slack in upper half of the circle and if 0 2 < \u2264 u gl, the combined mass will oscillate in lower half of the circle.

Determine (i) the common velocity of A and B at time t0 , and (ii) the spring constant. Solution Initially, the blocks A and B are at rest and C is moving with velocity v0 to the right. As masses of C and A are same and the collision is elastic the body C transfers its whole momentum mv0 to body A and as a result the body C stops and A starts moving with velocity v0 to the right.

Note Here, the thrust force ( ) Ft applied by the chain on the table will be vertically downwards, as F v dm dt t r = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 and in this expression vr is downwards plus dm dt is positive. So, Ft will be downwards. V Example 24 A ball of mass m makes an elastic collision with another identical ball at rest.

(d) If Assertion is false but the Reason is true. 1. Assertion : Centre of mass of a rigid body always lies inside the body. Reason : Centre of mass and centre of gravity coincide if gravity is uniform. 2. Assertion : A constant force F is applied on two blocks and one spring system as shown in figure. Velocity of centre of mass increases linearly with time. Reason : Acceleration of centre of mass is constant. 3. Assertion : To conserve linear momentum of a system, no force should act on the system. Reason : If net force on a system is zero, its linear momentum should remain constant. 4. Assertion : A rocket moves forward by pushing the surrounding air backwards. Reason : It derives the necessary thrust to move forward according to Newton\u2019s third law of motion. 5. Assertion : Internal forces cannot change linear momentum. Reason : Internal forces can change the kinetic energy of a system. 6. Assertion : In case of bullet fired from gun, the ratio of kinetic energy of gun and bullet is equal to ratio of mass of bullet and gun. Reason : Kinetic energy \u221d 1 mass ; if momentum is constant. 7. Assertion : All surfaces shown in figure are smooth. System is released from rest. Momentum of system in horizontal direction is constant but overall momentum is not constant. Reason : A net vertically upward force is acting on the system. 8. Assertion : During head on collision between two bodies let \u2206p1 is change in momentum of first body and \u2206p2 the change in momentum of the other body, then \u2206 = \u2206 p p 1 2.

The objects move towards each other under the gravitational force between them. In this motion, centre of mass of their system will continuously move towards the heavier mass m2. Reason : In a system of a heavier and a lighter mass, centre of mass lies closer to the heavier mass. 14. Assertion : A given force applied in turn to a number of different masses may cause the same rate of change in momentum in each but not the same acceleration to all. Reason : F p a F = = d dt m and 15. Assertion : In an elastic collision between two bodies, the relative speed of the bodies after collision is equal to the relative speed before the collision.

A rigid body is made up of too many particles but distance between any two particles is always constant. In any type of motion of a rigid body this distance always remains constant. A particle has only translational motion. Even if a particle is rotating in a circle it has only translational motion and it has only translational kinetic energy 1 2 2 mv . A rigid body may have either of the following three types of motions : (i) Translational motion (ii) Rotational motion (iii) Translational plus rotational motion In translational motion of the rigid body all particles of the rigid body have same linear displacement, same linear velocity and same linear acceleration. In rest two motions, different particles have different linear displacement, different linear velocity and different linear acceleration. As far as translational motion is concerned we do not differentiate between a particle and a rigid body. This motion is already discussed in the chapter of kinematics. This is the reason, in the chapter of kinematics, sometimes we write: a particle is moving and sometimes we write: a block (or a body) is moving. Rest two motions are only defined for a rigid body. In the present chapter, we shall discuss these two motions of a rigid body. 12.2 Moment of Inertia Like the centre of mass, the moment of inertia is a property of an object that is related to its mass distribution. The moment of inertia (denoted by I ) is an important quantity in the study of system of particles that are rotating . The role of the moment of inertia in the study of rotational motion is analogous to that of mass in the study of linear motion. Moment of inertia gives a measurement of the resistance of a body to a change in its rotational motion. If a body is at rest, the larger the moment of inertia of a body, the more difficult it is to put that body into rotational motion. Similarly, the larger the moment of inertia of a body, the more difficult it is to stop its rotational motion. The moment of inertia is calculated about some axis (usually the rotational axis) and it depends on the mass as well as its distribution about that axis. Moment of Inertia of a Single Particle For a very simple case the moment of inertia of a single particle about an axis is given by, I mr = 2 \u2026(i) Here, m is the mass of the particle and r its distance from the axis under consideration. 92 \u0097 Mechanics - II r m Fig. 12.1  Moment of Inertia of a System of Particles The moment of inertia of a system of particles about an axis is given by, I m r i i i = \u03a3 2 \u2026(ii) where, ri is the perpendicular distance from the axis to the ith particle, which has a mass mi . For example, in Fig. 12.2: I m r m r m r = + + 1 1 2 2 2 2 3 3 2 Moment of Inertia of Rigid Bodies For a continuous mass distribution such as found in a rigid body, we replace the summation of Eq. (ii) by an integral. If the system is divided into infinitesimal elements of mass dm and if r is the distance from a mass element to the axis of rotation, the moment of inertia is, I r dm = \u222b 2 where the integral is taken over the system. Moment of Inertia of a Uniform Cylinder Let us find the moment of inertia of a uniform cylinder about an axis through its centre of mass and perpendicular to its base. Mass of the cylinder is M and radius is R. We first divide the cylinder into annular shells of width dr and length l as shown in figure. The moment of inertia of one of these shells is dI r dm r dV = = \u22c5 2 2 ( ) \u03c1 Here, \u03c1 = density of cylinder and dV = volume of shell = 2\u03c0rl dr \u2234 dI l r dr = 2 3 \u03c0\u03c1 Chapter 12 Rotational Mechanics \u0097 93 r1 m1 m2 r2 m3 r3 Fig. 12.2 dm r Fig. 12.3 l (a) (b) r R dr Fig. 12.4  The cylinder\u2019s moment of inertia is found by integrating this expression between 0 and R, So, I l r dr l R R = = \u222b 2 2 3 0 4 \u03c0\u03c1 \u03c0\u03c1 \u2026(iii) The density \u03c1 of the cylinder is the mass divided by the volume. \u2234 \u03c1 \u03c0 = M R l 2 \u2026(iv) From Eqs.

Let us now discuss both of them. Theorem of Parallel Axes A very useful theorem, called the parallel axes theorem relates the moment of inertia of a rigid body about two parallel axes, one of which passes through the centre of mass. Two such axes are shown in figure for a body of mass M. If r is the distance between the axes and ICOM and I are the respective moments of inertia about them then, these two are related by, I I Mr = + ",

Proof To prove this theorem, we consider two axes, both parallel to the z-axis, one through the center of mass and the other through a point P (Fig 12.6). First we take a very thin slice of the body, parallel to the xy-plane and perpendicular to the z-axis. We take the origin of our coordinate system to be at the centre of mass of the body; the coordinates of the centre of mass are then x y z cm cm cm = = = 0. The axis through the centre of mass passes through this thin slice at pointO and the parallel axis passes through point P, whose x and ycoordinates are ( , ) a b . The distance of this axis from the axis through the centre of mass is r, where r a b 2 2 2 = + . We can write an expression for the moment of inertia I P about the axis through point P. Let mi be a mass element in our slice, with coordinates ( , , ) x y z i i i . Then, the moment of inertia ICOM of the slice about the axis through the centre of mass (at O) is I m x y i i i i COM = + \u03a3 ( ) 2 2 The moment of inertia of the slice about the axis through P is I m x a y b P i i i i = \u2212 + \u2212 \u03a3 [( ) ( ) ] 2 2 These expressions don\u2019t involve the coordinates zi measured perpendicular to the slice, so we can extend the sums to include all particles in all slices. Then, I P becomes the moment of inertia of the entire body for an axis through P. We then expand the squared terms, regroup and obtain I m x y a m x b m y a y m P i i i i i i i i i i i i = + \u2212 \u2212 + + \u03a3 \u03a3 \u03a3 \u03a3 ( ) ( ) 2 2 2 2 2 2 The first sum is ICOM . From the, definition of the centre of mass the second and third sums are proportional to xcm and ycm . These are zero because we have taken our origin to be the centre of mass. The final term is r 2 multiplied by the total mass or r 2. This completes our proof that I I Mr P = + ",

I2 is least among I I 1 2 , and I3. Similarly, I5 is least among I I 4 5 , and I6. Theorem of Perpendicular Axes This theorem is applicable only to the plane bodies (two dimensional). The theorem states that the moment of inertia of a plane lamina about an axis perpendicular to the plane of the lamina is equal to the sum of the moments of inertia of the lamina about two axes perpendicular to each other, in its own plane and intersecting each other, at the point where the perpendicular axis passes through it. Let x and y axes be chosen in the plane of the body and z-axis perpendicular, to this plane, three axes being mutually perpendicular, then the theorem states that I I I z x y = + Proof Consider an arbitrary particle P of mass mi , distant ri fromO and xi and yi are the perpendicular distances of point P from the x and y-axes respectively, we have I m r z i i i = \u03a3 2, I m y x i i i = \u03a3 2 and I m x y i i i = \u03a3 2 So that, I I m y m x x y i i i i i i + = + \u03a3 \u03a3 2 2 = + \u03a3 i i i i m y x ( ) 2 2 = \u03a3 i i i m r 2 = I z i.e. I I I z x y = + Hence Proved.

It is represented by \u03c9. Its SI unit is radian per second. It can be defined for following three situations : (i) Angular velocity of a particle (in motion) about a fixed point. (ii) Angular velocity of a rigid body in pure rotational motion. (iii) Angular velocity of a rigid body in rotational and translational motion. Angular Velocity of a Particle (in motion) about a Fixed Point At a given instant a particle P has velocity v. It has position vector r with respect to a fixed point O as shown in figure. After some time position vector has become r\u2032. We can see two changes in its position vector. First, its magnitude | |r has changed, second its direction has changed or we can say, its position vector has been rotated. If we resolve v along r and perpendicular to r then its two components v|| and v\u22a5have the following meanings. v v || = = \u22c5 cos\u03b8 v r r = component of v along r = d dt | | r = rate by which magnitude of r changes = rate by which distance of P from O changes. \u03b8 = angle between r and v v v r v ",

Before, analyzing the circular motion of point P, we will first study the angular motion properties of a rigid body. Angular Motion Since, a point is without dimension, it has no angular motion. Only lines or bodies undergo angular motion. Let us consider the angular motion of a radial line r located with the shaded plane. Angular Position The angular position of r is defined by the angle \u03b8, measured between a fixed reference line OA and r. Angular Displacement The change in the angular position, often measured as a differential d\u03b8 is called the angular displacement. (Finite angular displacements are not vector quantities, although differential rotations d\u03b8 are vectors). This vector has a magnitude d\u03b8 and the direction of d\u03b8 is along the axis. Specifically, the direction of d\u03b8 is determined by right hand rule; that is, the fingers of the right hand are curled with the sense of rotation, so that in this case the thumb or d\u03b8 points upward. Angular Velocity The time rate of change in the angular position is called the angular velocity \u03c9. Thus, \u03c9 \u03b8 = d dt \u2026(i) It is expressed here in scalar form, since its direction is always along the axis of rotation, i.e. in the same direction as d\u03b8. Angular Acceleration The angular acceleration \u03b1 measures the time rate of change of the angular velocity. Hence, the magnitude of this vector may be written as, Chapter 12 Rotational Mechanics \u0097 109 \u03b8 P r d\u03b8 \u03c9 \u03b1 d\u03b8 O A Fig. 12.41 O d\u03b8 \u03b8 P r \u03b1 \u03c9 A Fig. 12.42  \u03b1 \u03c9 = d dt \u2026(ii) It is also possible to express \u03b1 as, \u03b1 \u03b8 = d dt 2 2 The line of action of \u03b1 is the same as that for\u03c9, however its sense of direction depends on whether\u03c9is increasing or decreasing with time. In particular, if\u03c9is decreasing,\u03b1 is called an angular deceleration and therefore, has a sense of direction which is opposite to \u03c9. Torque and Angular Acceleration for a Rigid Body The angular acceleration of a rigid body is directly proportional to the sum of the torque components along the axis of rotation. The proportionality constant is the inverse of the moment of inertia about that axis, or \u03b1 \u03c4 = \u03a3 I Thus, for a rigid body we have the rotational analog of Newton\u2019s second law : \u03a3\u03c4 \u03b1 = I \u2026(iii) Following two points are important regarding the above equation : (i) The above equation is valid only for rigid bodies. If the body is not rigid like a rotating tank of water, the angular acceleration \u03b1 is different for different particles. (ii) The sum \u03a3\u03c4 in the above equation includes only the torques of the external forces, because all the internal torques add to zero. Rotation with Constant Angular Acceleration If the angular acceleration of the body is constant then Eqs. (i) and (ii) when integrated yield a set of formulae which relate the body\u2019s angular velocity, angular position and time. These equations are similar to equations used for rectilinear motion. Table given ahead compares the linear and angular motion with constant acceleration.

Note If \u03b1 is not constant then we will have to take help of either differentiation or integration (with limits). The equations involved are : 110 \u0097 Mechanics - II  Extra Points to Remember Equations of Differentiation \u03c9 \u03b8 = d dt and \u03b1 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b8 = = d dt d d Equations of Integration d dt d dt \u222b \u222b \u222b \u222b = = \u03b8 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b1 , and \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u222b \u222b = d d Kinetic Energy of a Rigid Body Rotating about a Fixed Axis Suppose a rigid body is rotating about a fixed axis with angular speed \u03c9. Then, kinetic energy of the rigid body will be K m v i i i = \u03a3 1 2 2 = \u03a3 i i i m r 1 2 2 ( ) \u03c9 = 1 2 2 2 \u03c9 \u03a3 i i i m r = 1 2 2 I\u03c9 (as \u03a3 i i i m r I 2 = ) Thus, KE = 1 2 2 I\u03c9 Sometimes it is called the rotational kinetic energy. \u0098 In pure rotational motion of a rigid body all particles rotate in circular paths except the particles lying on the axis.The particles lying on the axis are at rest. \u0098 Planes of all circular paths are mutually parallel with their centres lying on the axis. \u0098 Linear velocity of any particle is tangential to its own circle and its linear speed is, v r = \u03c9 In this equation, \u03c9 is same for all particles (and that is also called \u03c9 of the rigid body). \u2234 v r \u221d In the figure shown, r r 2 1 > \u21d2\u2234v v 2 1 > Further, r for the particles lying on the axis is zero. Therefore, their linear velocity is zero or they are at rest. \u0098 Since every particle is rotating in a circle (except the particles lying on the axis). Hence acceleration of the particle has two components : (i) Radial component or centripetal acceleration given by a r v r r = = \u03c92 2 This component is always towards the centre and this can't be zero. (ii) Tangential component given by a dv dt r t = = \u03b1 where, \u03b1 \u03c9 =d dt This component is tangential and it may be zero, positive or negative. If v or\u03c9is constant then at is zero. If v or \u03c9 is increasing then this component is positive and in the direction of linear velocity. If v or \u03c9 is decreasing then this component is negative and in the opposite direction of linear velocity. (iii) Net acceleration of the particle is the resultant of these two perpendicular components. Chapter 12 Rotational Mechanics \u0097 111 \u03c9 ri mi Fig. 12.43 ",

When a mass rotates about some point/axis, there is momentum associated with rotational motion called the angular momentum ( ) L . Just as net external force is required to change the linear momentum of an object a net external torque is required to change the angular momentum of an object. Keeping in view the problems asked in JEE, the angular momentum is classified in following three types. Angular Momentum of a Particle about a Fixed Point Suppose a particle A of mass m is moving with linear momentum P v = m . Its angular momentum L about point O is defined as L r P r v r v = \u00d7 = \u00d7 = \u00d7 ( ) ( ) m m Here, r is the radius vector of particle A about O at that instant of time. The magnitude of L is L mvr mvr = = \u22a5 sin \u03b8 Here, r r \u22a5= sin \u03b8 is the perpendicular distance of line of action of velocity v from point O. The direction of L is same as that of r v \u00d7 . Direction of angular momentum can also be by right hand rule as shown below: In figures (a) and (c), rotation is clockwise. Hence, according to right hand rule angular momentum is perpendicular to paper inwards or in \u2297direction. In figures (b) and (d), rotation is anticlockwise. Hence, direction of angular momentum is perpendicular to paper outwards or in O. direction.

Therefore, angular momentum is zero. \u0098 If a particle rotates in a circle then r\u22a5from centre is always equal to R (= radius of circle). Or, \u03b8 between r and v (or P) is always 90\u00b0. Therefore, angular momentum about centre is L mv R = In figure (a), direction of angular momentum is perpendicular to paper inwards \u2297and in figure (b) outwards or O. . \u0098 If a particle is moving with a constant velocity (speed and direction of velocity both are constant) then angular momentum about any point always remains constant. But this constant value will be different about different points. In the figure shown, ",

Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body Rotating about a Fixed Axis Suppose a particle P of mass m is going in a circle of radius r and at some instant the speed of the particle is v. For finding the angular momentum of the particle about the axis of rotation, the origin may be chosen anywhere on the axis. We choose it at the centre of the circle. In this case r and P are perpendicular to each other and r P \u00d7 is along the axis. Thus, component of r P \u00d7 along the axis is mvr itself. The angular momentum of the whole rigid body about AB is the sum of components of all particles, i.e. L m r v i i i i = \u03a3 Here, v r i i = \u03c9 \u2234 L m r i i i = \u03a3 2\u03c9 or L m r i i i = \u03c9 \u03a3 2 or L I = \u03c9 (as \u03a3 i i i m r I 2 = ) Here, I is the moment of inertia of the rigid body about AB. Thus, L I = \u03c9 is the component of angular momentum of the whole rigid body about axis of rotation AB. Direction of this component is again given by right hand rule. For example, in the given figure L I = \u03c9 is upwards or along the axis of rotation from B to A. 116 \u0097 Mechanics - II C R R v (a) C v (b) Fig. 12.51 b v v ",

If however the body is symmetric about the axis of rotation L and \u03c9 are parallel and we can write ( ) L I = \u03c9 in vector form as L = I\u03c9.. \u0098 By symmetric we mean that for every mass element in the body there must be an identical mass element diametrically opposite the first element and at the same distance from the axis of rotation. \u0098 Thus, remember that L = I\u03c9 applies only to bodies that have symmetry about the (fixed) rotational axis. Here, L stands for total angular momentum. However the relation L I AB = \u03c9 holds for any rigid body symmetrical or not that is rotating about a fixed axis. Angular Momentum of a Rigid Body in Combined Rotation and Translation Let O be the fixed point in an inertial frame of reference. Angular momentum of the rigid body about O is the vector sum of two terms (as discussed above). (i) mvrsin\u03b8 or mvr\u22a5 (ii) I\u03c9 Here, v is the velocity of centre of mass. Moment of inertia I is about an axis passing through centre of mass. Directions of above two terms can be determined by right hand rule. If both the terms are in the same direction then these two terms are additive and if they are in opposite directions, then they are subtractive.

Solution | | sin L = mvr \u03b8 = \u22a5 mvr = mvb \u2234 | | L = constant as m v , and b all are constants. Direction of r v \u00d7 also remains the same. Therefore, angular momentum of particle about origin remains constant with due course of time. Note In this problem | |r is increasing, \u03b8 is decreasing but r sin ,\u03b8 i.e. b remains constant. Hence, the angular momentum remains constant.

Chapter 12 Rotational Mechanics \u0097 119 l 2l O \u03c9 Fig. 12.60 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 12.5 O R v x y Fig. 12.61 v O Fig. 12.59  12.7 Conservation of Angular Momentum As we have seen in Article 12.6, the angular momentum of a particle about some reference point O is defined as, L r p = \u00d7 \u2026(i) Here, P is the linear momentum of the particle and r its position vector with respect to the reference point O. Differentiating Eq. (i)  with respect to time, we get d dt d dt d dt L r p r p = \u00d7 + \u00d7 \u2026(ii) Here, d dt p F = and d dt r v = (velocity of particle) Hence, Eq. (ii) can be rewritten as, d dt L r F v p = \u00d7 + \u00d7 Now, v p \u00d7 = a null vector, because v and pare parallel to each other and the cross product of two parallel vectors is a null vector. Thus, d dt L r F = \u00d7 = \u03c4 or \u03c4 = d dt L \u2026(iii) Which states that the time rate of change of angular momentum of a particle about some reference point in an inertial frame of reference is equal to the net torques acting on it. This result is rotational analog of the equation F p = d dt , which states that the time rate of change of the linear momentum of a particle is equal to the force acting on it. Eq. (iii), like all vector equations, is equivalent to three scalar equations, namely \u03c4 x x dL dt = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7, \u03c4 y y dL dt = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 and \u03c4 z z dL dt = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 The same equation can be generalised for a system of particles as,\u03c4 ext = d dt L.According to which the time rate of change of the total angular momentum of a system of particles about some reference point in an inertial frame of reference is equal to the sum of all external torques (of course the vector sum) acting on the system about the same reference point. Now, suppose that \u03c4 ext = 0, then d dt L = 0, so that L = constant. When the resultant external torque acting on a system is zero, the total vector angular momentum of the system remains constant. This is the principle of the conservation of angular momentum. For a rigid body rotating about an axis (the z-axis, say) that is fixed in an inertial reference frame, we have L I z = \u03c9 It is possible for the moment of inertia I of a rotating body to change by rearrangement of its parts. If no net external torque acts, then Lz must remain constant and if I does change, there must be a 120 \u0097 Mechanics - II  compensating change in\u03c9. The principle of conservation of angular momentum in this case is expressed as I\u03c9 = constant or I I 1 1 2 2 \u03c9 \u03c9 = \u2026(iv) Note According to above equation, if some mass moves away from the axis of rotation, its moment of inertia will increase. So, to conserve angular momentum or I\u03c9 its angular speed \u03c9 should decrease. Therefore, time period of rotation T = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2\u03c0 \u03c9 should also increase. V Example 12.17 A wheel of moment of inertia I and radius R is rotating about its axis at an angular speed \u03c90. It picks up a stationary particle of mass m at its edge. Find the new angular speed of the wheel. Solution Net external torque on the system is zero. Therefore, angular momentum will remain conserved. Thus, I I 1 1 2 2 \u03c9 \u03c9 = or \u03c9 \u03c9 2 1 1 2 = I I Here, I I 1 = , \u03c9 \u03c9 1 0 = , I I mR 2 2 = + \u2234 \u03c9 \u03c9 2 0 2 = + I I mR Ans. 1. A thin circular ring of mass M and radius R is rotating about its axis with an angular speed \u03c90. Two particles each of mass m are now attached at diametrically opposite points. Find the new angular speed of the ring. 2. If the ice at the poles melts and flows towards the equator, how will it affect the duration of day-night? 3. When tall buildings are constructed on earth, the duration of day night slightly increases. Is this statement true or false? 4. If radius of earth is increased, without change in its mass, will the length of day increase, decrease or remain same? 12.8 Combined Translational and Rotational Motion of a Rigid Body This is the most complex motion of a rigid body. But this can be simplified by splitting this motion into following two parts: (i) pure translational motion with the velocity ( ) v and acceleration ( ) a of centre of mass. (ii) pure rotational motion about an axis passing through centre of mass with angular velocity \u03c9 and angular acceleration \u03b1. As we have discussed earlier also, different particles of the rigid body in this type of motion have different linear velocity and linear acceleration. So, now the question is how to find linear velocity and linear acceleration of a general particle P on the rigid body?

In circular motion, velocity of a particle is r\u03c9, tangential to its circle (in the direction of rotation). So, v PC is r\u03c9 in the tangential direction as shown in Fig. 12.62. Thus net velocity of P is the vector sum of following two terms: (i) v and (ii) r\u03c9 For different particles, values of v and\u03c9are same. But values of r and therefore r\u03c9and direction of r\u03c9 are different . This is the reason why different particles have different linear velocities.

In circular motion, acceleration of a particle has two components: (i) tangential component, at (ii) radial component, ar Here, a r t = \u03b1 (where, \u03b1 \u03c9 = d dt ) This component is tangential in the direction of linear velocity if \u03c9 is increasing and in the opposite direction of linear velocity if \u03c9 is decreasing.

For example, consider a disc of radius R moving with linear velocity v and angular velocity \u03c9 on a horizontal ground. The disc is said to be moving without slipping if velocities of points P and Q (shown in figure  12.71 (b) are equal, i.e. v v P Q = or v R \u2212 = \u03c9 0 or v R = \u03c9 If v v P Q > or v R > \u03c9, the motion is said to be in forward slipping and if v v P Q < or v R < \u03c9, the motion is said to be in backward slipping (or sometimes called forward English). In pure rolling ( ) v R = \u03c9 over a stationary ground net velocity of bottommost point of the body is zero. In forward slip condition ( ) v R > \u03c9 net velocity is in the direction of motion. In backward slip condition ( ) v R < \u03c9 net velocity is in the opposite direction of motion. Thus, v R = \u03c9 is the condition of pure rolling on a stationary ground. Sometimes it is simply said rolling. Suppose the base over which the disc in rolling, is also moving with some velocity (say v0) then in that case condition of pure rolling is different. For example, in the Fig. 12.72, v v P Q = or v R v \u2212 = \u03c9 0 Thus, in this case v R \u2212 \u2260 \u03c9 0, but v R v \u2212 = \u03c9 0. By uniform pure rolling we mean that v and \u03c9 are constant. They are neither increasing nor decreasing. 126 \u0097 Mechanics - II v \u03c9 ",

But this motion can be simplified and may be assumed to be in pure rotational motion (with same \u03c9) about an axis called instantaneous axis of rotation. Further as we know that, in pure rotational motion, points lying on the axis of rotation are at rest. Therefore, we can say that, instantaneous axis of rotation passes through those points which are at rest. For example, in pure rolling over ground instantaneous axis of rotation (IAOR) passes through the bottommost point, as it is a point of zero velocity. Thus, the combined motion of rotation and translation can be assumed to be pure rotational motion about bottommost point with same angular speed \u03c9. Now, there are two uses of the concept of instantaneous axis of rotation. (i) Velocity of any point P can obtained by a single term v r = \u03c9 as in pure rotational motion this is the expression of velocity of any point P. Here r is the distance of P from instantaneous axis of rotation. With respect to O, point P is rotating in a circle with centre at O and radius as r. Velocity of P is tangential to this circle (or perpendicular to OP), in the direction of rotation. (ii) We can find total kinetic energy of the body by a single term. K I = 1 2 2 \u03c9 But here, I is the moment of inertia about instantaneous axis of rotation. V Example 12.23 Using the concept of instantaneous axis of rotation.

Now, suppose an external force is applied to the rigid body, the motion will no longer remain uniform. The condition of pure rolling on a stationary ground is, v R = \u03c9 Differentiating this equation with respect to time, we have dv dt R d dt = . \u03c9 or a R = \u03b1 Thus, in addition to v R = \u03c9 at every instant of time there is one additional condition, linear acceleration = \u00d7 R angular acceleration or a R = \u03b1 for pure rolling to take place. Here, friction plays an important role in maintaining the pure rolling. The friction may sometimes act in forward direction, sometimes in backward direction or under certain conditions it may be zero. Here, we should not forget the basic nature of friction, which is a self adjusting force (upto a certain maximum limit) and which has a tendency to stop the relative motion between two bodies in contact and here the relative motion stops when at every instant v R = \u03c9. To satisfy this equation all the time, a R = \u03b1 equation should also be satisfied. Let us take an example illustrating the above theory. Suppose a force F is applied at the topmost point of a rigid body of radius R, mass M and moment of inertia I about an axis passing through the centre of mass. Now, the applied force F can produce by itself: (i) a linear acceleration a and (ii) an angular acceleration \u03b1. If a R = \u03b1, then there is no need of friction and force of friction f = 0. If a R < \u03b1, then to support the linear motion the force of friction f will act in forward direction. Similarly, if a R > \u03b1, then to support the angular motion the force of friction will act in backward direction. So, in this case force of friction will be either backward, forward or even zero also. It all depends on M, I and R. For calculation purpose initially we can choose any direction of friction. Let we assume it in forward direction, Let, a = linear acceleration, \u03b1 = angular acceleration then, a F M F f M = = + net \u2026(i) \u03b1 \u03c4 = = \u2212 c I F f R I ( ) \u2026(ii) For pure rolling to take place, a R = \u03b1 \u2026(iii) Solving Eqs.

Have you ever thought why it happens so. To understand it in a better way let us take an example. Suppose a force F is applied at a height b above the base AE of the block. Further, suppose the friction f is sufficient to prevent sliding. In this case, if the normal reaction N also passes through C, then despite the fact that the block is in translational equilibrium (F f = and N mg = ), an unbalanced torque (due to the couple of forces F and f) is there. This torque has a tendency to topple the block about point E. To cancel the effect of this unbalanced torque the normal reaction N is shifted towards right a distance \u2018a\u2019 such that, net anticlockwise torque is equal to the net clockwise torque or Fb mg a = ( ) or a Fb mg = Now, if F or b (or both) is increased, distance a also increases. But it can not go beyond the right edge of the block. So, in extreme case (beyond which the block will topple down), the normal reaction passes through E as shown in Fig. 12.113 (b). Now, if F or b is further increased, the block will topple down. This is why the block having the broader base has less chances of toppling in comparison to a block of smaller base. Because the block of larger base has more margin for the normal reaction to shift. On the similar ground we can see why the rolling is so easy. Because in this case the normal reaction has zero margin to shift. So even if the body is in translational equilibrium (F f = , N mg = ) an unbalanced torque is left behind and the body starts toppling and here the toppling means motion. Under ideal conditions, the body will start moving by a very small force F tending to zero also.

A horizontal force F is applied normal to one of the faces at a point directly above the centre of the face, at a height 3 4 a above the base. What is the minimum value of F for which the cube begins to tip about an edge? Solution In the limiting case normal reaction will pass through O. The cube will tip about O if torque of F exceeds the torque of mg.

Whether a particle is in translational motion, rotational motion or in both it merely depends on the reference point with respect to which the motion of the particle is described. For example: a particle P of mass m is moving in a straight line as shown in figures (a), (b) and (c). Refer Fig. (a) With respect to point A, the particle is in pure translational motion. Hence, kinetic energy of the particle can be written as KE = 1 2 2 mv Refer Fig. (b) With respect to point B, the particle is in pure rotational motion. Hence, the kinetic energy of the particle can be  written as KE = 1 2 2 I\u03c9 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 2 2 2 ( ) mr v r = 1 2 2 mv Refer Fig. (c) With respect to point C, the particle can be assumed to be in rotational as well as translational motion. Hence, the kinetic energy of the particle can be written as KE = + 1 2 1 2 2 2 m v I ( cos ) \u03b8 \u03c9 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 m v mr v r ( cos ) ( ) sin \u03b8 \u03b8 = 1 2 2 mv Thus, in all the three cases, the kinetic energy of the particle comes out to be the same. 2. In cases where pulley is having some mass and friction is sufficient enough to prevent slipping, the tension on two sides of the pulley will be different and rotational motion of the pulley is also to be considered. 3. Finite angular displacements are not vector quantities, the reason being that they do not obey the law of vector addition. This law asserts that the order in which vectors are added does not affect their sum. A B B A + = + It can be seen applying two successive 90\u00b0 rotations-one about the x-axis, and the other about the z-axis to a six-sided dice. In the first case, the z-rotation is applied before the x-rotation and vice versa in the second case. It can be seen that the dice ends up in two completely different states. Clearly, the z-rotation plus the x-rotation does not equal the x-rotation plus the z-rotation. This non-commutative algebra cannot be represented by vectors. We conclude that, rotations are not, in general, vector quantities. However infinitesimal angles do commute under addition, making it possible to treat them as vectors.

Rotation plus translation motion of a rigid body is simplified by splitting this motion into two parts. (i) pure translation motion with the linear velocity and acceleration of the centre of mass. (ii) pure rotational motion about an axis passing through centre of mass and perpendicular to the plane of motion of the particles. But this motion may be considered as pure rotational motion about an axis called instantaneous axis of rotation (say IAOR). If this IAOR is non-inertial, then we cannot apply, \u03c4 \u03b1 ext =I about this axis. This is because in the derivation of this equation we useF ma = for each particle. If IAOR has an accelerationa, we have to apply a pseudo force \u2212ma to each particle. These pseudo forces produce a pseudo torque about this axis. But this equation can be applied about an axis passing through centre of mass even if this is non-inertial. Let us prove this: Take the origin at the centre of mass. The total torque of the pseudo force is \u03a3 \u03a3 r a r a i i i i i m m \u00d7 \u2212 = \u2212 \u00d7 ( ) ( ) = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7\u00d7 M m M i i \u03a3 r a But \u03a3m M i ir is the position vector of the centre of mass and that is zero as the centre of mass is at the origin. Hence, the torque of pseudo forces acting on all particles of the rigid body is zero. 144 \u0097 Mechanics - II  ",

It can have only rotational motion in a vertical plane about a smooth horizontal axis passing through O and perpendicular to plane of paper. It is released from the horizontal position. As the rod rotates downwards its gravitational potential energy decreases and rotational kinetic energy increases. 146 \u0097 Mechanics - II \u21d2 O O \u03c9 C B A v D  How to Solve? l Put decrease in gravitational potential energy (mgh) equal to increase in rotational kinetic energy 1 2 2 I \u03c9 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7.

V Example 3 A uniform circular disc has radius R and mass m. A particle, also of mass m, is fixed at a point A on the edge of the disc as shown in the figure. The disc can rotate freely about a horizontal chord PQ that is at a distance R/4 from the centre C of the disc. The line AC is perpendicular to PQ. Initially the disc is held vertical with the point A at its highest position. It is then allowed to fall, so that it starts rotation about PQ.

Type 4. Based on Angular Impulse. Concept Angular impulse A.I = \u03c4 \u2206t If torque is a function of time, then A.I =\u222b\u03c4 dt and this angular impulse is equal to the change in angular momentum. V Example 4 A solid sphere of mass \u2018m\u2019 and radius \u2018R\u2019 is kept over a rough ground. A time varying force F t =2 is acting at the topmost point as shown in figure. (a) Find angular momentum of the sphere about the bottommost point as a function of time \u2018t\u2019. (b) Does this result depend on the fact whether the ground is rough or smooth? Solution (a) Suppose \u2018f \u2019 is the force of friction acting on the sphere in forward direction as shown in figure. Taking torque about bottommost point O. Torque of friction is already zero, as this force already passes through O. Torque of applied force is only there. \u2234 \u03c4 = \u00d7 \u22a5 F r = ( ) ( ) 2 2 t R = 4 RT As, this toque is a function of time. \u2234Angular impulse = =\u222b \u222b\u03c4 dt Rt dt t t ( ) 4 0 0 = 2 2 Rt This angular impulse is equal to  change in angular momentum. Hence, angular momentum at time \u2018t\u2019 is 2 2 Rt . (b) This result is independent of the nature of surface (smooth or rough), as the torque of friction about bottommost point is already zero. It does not contribute in angular impulse and therefore in angular momentum. 148 \u0097 Mechanics - II F t = 2 Rough F t = 2 C O f 2R  Type 5. Role of friction in acceleration pure rolling. Concept Friction has a tendency to stop the relative motion. In case of rolling (rotation + translation) over a stationary ground relative motion is stopped when v R = \u03c9 equation is satisfied at all instants. To satisfy this equation, a should be equal to \u2018R\u03b1\u2019. Hence, friction has a tendency to satisfy the equation,a R = \u03b1. Sometimes friction is sufficient and sometimes not. If friction is sufficient, then accelerated pure rolling will takes place. Otherwise forward or backward slipping occurs. How to Solve? l Find N, \u00b5 sN and \u00b5kN (or \u00b5N) l Find requirement of friction to satisfy the equation a R = \u03b1. l For this, apply a general value of f in either forward or backward direction. l Put a R = \u03b1 l or F m R I net net = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c4 l and find the required value of f for accelerated pure rolling. l If f N s \u2264\u00b5 i.e. requirement \u2264availability then pure rolling will take place and a R = \u03b1. In this case the obtained value of friction in step (iii) will act. l If f N s >\u00b5 then either forward or backward slip will take place and a R \u2260 \u03b1. But, l a F m = net and \u03b1 \u03c4 = net I l are still applicable. l In this case, \u00b5kN friction will act. l If required value of friction in step (iii) comes out to be negative then just change the direction of friction which was initially assumed. Otherwise, magnitude wise all calculations are same. l After calculation, if force of friction comes in forward direction, then if there is slip, it is backward slip and a R < \u03b1. V Example 5 A solid sphere of mass 5 kg and radius 1 m is kept over a rough surface as shown in figure. A force F =30N is acting at the topmost point.

Based on conservation of mechanical energy and no change in rotational kinetic energy. Concept If a body is kept in translational plus rotational motion condition over a smooth inclined plane then two forces acting on the body (weight and normal reaction) pass through centre of mass. So, they cannot provide the torque and therefore angular acceleration. Therefore, its angular speed and rotational kinetic energy remains constant. Same is the case, when the body moves freely under gravity. Here, the only force acting on the body is \u2018mg\u2019 which also passes through centre of mass. When the body moves up, its translational kinetic energy decreases and gravitational potential energy increases but rotational kinetic energy remains constant. Opposite is the case when the body moves down. Further, in case of accelerated pure rolling over a stationary rough ground, work done by friction is zero. Hence, mechanical energy will remain constant. In this case, K K R T =1for ring = 1 2 for disc = 2 5 for solid sphere etc. Thus, total mechanical energy ( ) K K mgh R T + \u00b1 remains constant in case of accelerated pure rolling, over a smooth ground or under gravity.

Note that IC lie on that side of P which causes rotation about the IC, which is consistent with the direction of motion caused by \u03c9 and v. (ii) Given the lines of action of two non-parallel velocities Consider the body shown in figure where the line of action of the velocities v A and v B are known. Draw perpendiculars at A and B to these lines of action. The point of intersection of these perpendiculars as shown locates the IC at the instant considered.

Concept If a body is kept in forward or backward slip condition ( ) v R \u2260 \u03c9 over a rough horizontal ground, then kinetic friction will act in the opposite direction of slip. This friction provides both linear acceleration \u2018a\u2019 and angular acceleration \u2018\u03b1\u2019. They are in the directions so as the equation v R = \u03c9 (with proper sense of rotation) is satisfied so that pure rolling may start. For example, if initially v r > \u03c9, then \u2018a\u2019 is in the opposite direction of \u2018v\u2019 (to decrease it) and \u2018\u03b1\u2019 is in the direction of \u2018\u03c9\u2019 (to increase it). Once pure rolling starts, relative motion (or slipping) is stopped and friction becomes zero. During slip, mechanical energy is not conserved. But, some part of mechanical energy is used up in doing work against friction. Once pure rolling starts, mechanical energy becomes constant. If only one coefficient of friction or\u00b5 is given in the question then, instead of kinetic friction, apply \u00b5N during the slip. V Example 16 A solid sphere of radius r is gently placed on a rough horizontal ground with an initial angular speed \u03c90 and no linear velocity. If the coefficient of friction is \u00b5, find the time t when the slipping stops. In addition, state the linear velocity v and angular velocity \u03c9 at the end of slipping.

The ball leaves the cue with a speed v0 and because of its forward english (backward slipping) eventually acquires a final speed 9 7 0 v . Show that h R = 4 5 where R is the radius of the ball. Solution Let \u03c90 be the angular speed of the ball just after it leaves the cue. The maximum friction acts in forward direction till the slipping continues.

Concept If a force is applied on a block as shown in figure and the force is increased then in some cases the block slides before toppling and in other cases it topples before sliding. It mainly depends on: (i) base length a (ii) height of point of application of force h (iii) coefficient of friction \u00b5. For example, if\u00b5 is small then chances of sliding are more. If a is small then chances of toppling are more. For given values of a and h it only depends on the value of\u00b5. In such problems, there is a critical value \u00b5 cr. If given value of \u00b5 \u00b5 > cr, then the block topples before sliding and if \u00b5 <\u00b5 cr then the block slides before toppling. How to Solve? l Make two conditions: l Condition of sliding l Condition of toppling, when the normal reaction (just before toppling) shifts to the right side edge). l From these, two conditions we can find \u00b5cr. V Example 18 For the given dimensions shown in figure, find critical value of coefficient of friction \u00b5. Solution Condition of sliding The block will slide if, F N >\u00b5 but N mg = (m = mass of the block) \u2234 F mg >\u00b5 \u2026(i) Condition of toppling Chapter 12 Rotational Mechanics \u0097 161 F h a Rough F 2a 2a f F 2a a O f N mg  Block will topple about an axis passing through O and perpendicular to plane of paper if: clockwise torque of F > anticlockwise torque of mg \u2234 F a mg a ( ) ( )( ) 2 > or F mg > 1 2 \u2026(ii) From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we can see that, \u00b5cr = 1 2 Ans. If given value of \u00b5 is less than \u00b5cr (say it is 1 4) then Eq. (i) is, F mg > 1 4 So, Eq. (i) is satisfied before Eq. (ii). Therefore, the block will slide before toppling. If given value of \u00b5 is greater than \u00b5cr(say it is 3 4) then Eq. (i) is, F mg > 3 4 So, Eq. (ii) is satisfied before Eq. (i). Hence, the block will topple before sliding. Type 11. When pure translational motion of a rigid body converts into pure rotational motion by a jerk (or linear impulse). Concept A block in pure translational motion (with linear velocity v) meets an obstacle at O. A linear impulse will act on the block at point O. Just after the impact, the block starts rotating about point O (with an angular speed say \u03c9). The value of this \u2018\u03c9\u2019 can be found by conservation of angular momentum about O because during the impact, the angular impulse of the linear impulse about point O will be zero (as r\u22a5= 0). Just before impact motion is pure translational. So, angular momentum is m vr sin\u03b8 or mvr\u22a5. Here, v is the velocity of centre of mass. Just after impact motion is pure rotational. So, angular momentum is I\u03c9, where, I is the moment of inertia passing through O and perpendicular to plane of paper. Furthermore, there will be loss of mechanical energy during impact = \u2212 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 E E mv I i f 1 2 1 2 2 2 \u03c9 . But after impact, the mechanical energy remains constant. As the block moves up, its potential energy increases and rotational kinetic energy decreases.

To identify number of unknowns and then make equations corresponding to that. Concept A disc and block system are released from rest as shown in figure. Ground is sufficiently rough, so that there is no slip anywhere. We have to find accelerations of both, tension in the string and force of friction. In such problems, first of all find the number of unknowns: (i) Block can have only translational motion. So, it has some linear acceleration say a1 (ii) Disc can have translational as well as rotational motion. So, it has linear acceleration a2 and angular acceleration \u2018\u03b1\u2019. (iii) Ground is rough. So, there is one unknown friction \u2018f \u2019 (iv) One more unknown is tension in the string T. Therefore, there are total five unknowns in this problem, a1, a2, \u03b1, T and f . How to Solve? l We will make three acceleration equations for a1,a2 and \u03b1 by using the equations l a F m = net and \u03b1 \u03c4 = net I l There are two contact equations at c1 and c2. l At c1, disc is in contact with ground and at c2 with string. At the other end string is connected to the block. So, there should not be any slip at c1 between disc and ground and at c2 between disc and string. Following two examples illustrate the method of making these equations. V Example 20 Consider the arrangement shown in figure. The string is wrapped around a uniform cylinder which rolls without slipping. The other end of the string is passed over a massless, frictionless pulley to a falling weight. Determine the acceleration of the falling mass m in terms of only the mass of the cylinder M, the mass m and g. Solution Let T be the tension in the string and f the force of (static) friction, between the cylinder and the surface. a1 = acceleration of centre of mass of cylinder towards right a2 = downward acceleration of block m \u03b1 = angular acceleration of cylinder (clockwise) Acceleration equations For block, mg T ma \u2212 = 2 \u2026(i) 164 \u0097 Mechanics - II a1 T c1 f a2 T c2 \u03b1 m M \u03b1 T f a1 T a2 mg  For cylinder, T f Ma + = 1 \u2026(ii) \u03b1 = \u2212 ( ) T f R ",

Type 13. Energy method of solving problems of accelerated pure rolling. Concept In accelerated pure rolling over a stationary ground work done by friction is zero. So, mechanical energy remains constant. Therefore, some problems of accelerated pure rolling can also be solved by using energy conservation principle. V Example 22 A body of mass m, radius R and moment of inertia I (about an axis passing through the centre of mass and perpendicular to plane of motion) is released from rest over a sufficiently rough ground (to provide accelerated pure rolling). Find linear acceleration of the body. Solution Let linear acceleration is \u2018a\u2019 and angular acceleration \u2018\u03b1\u2019.

Problems of accelerated pure rolling by finding angular acceleration \u2018\u03b1\u2019 about the bottommost axis. Concept We have discussed in final touch points that : \u03b1 \u03c4 = ext I can be applied from an inertial frame or about an axis passing through centre of mass (even if it is accelerated). Same is the case about an axis passing through bottommost axis if accelerated pure rolling is taking place on a stationary ground. Although the bottommost point is accelerated (= R\u03c9 2, towards centre), yet for symmetrical bodies net torque of pseudo forces on all particles of the rigid body about bottommost axis is zero. So, \u03b1 \u03c4 = ext I can be applied about this axis also. V Example 23 In example 22, find linear acceleration \u2018a\u2019 of the body by calculating \u03b1 about bottommost axis.

Based on hinge force. Concept A rod OA is hinged at O. It is released from the horizontal position as shown in figure. We have to find hinge force acting on the rod at a general angle \u03b8. We can see that motion of the rod is pure rotational about an axis passing through O. As the rod rotates downwards, its gravitational potential energy decreases and rotational kinetic energy increases. If the hinge is smooth, then we can apply the equation.

At the same time, we can see that \u03c9 is increasing. So, there is an angular acceleration \u2018\u03b1\u2019 about O. Only two forces are acting on the rod, hinge force and weight. Torque of hinge force about O is zero. Therefore, torque of \u2018mg\u2019 will only provide \u2018\u03b1\u2019.

Concept There are mainly three types of collisions. Type 1. A ball of mass M is suspended by a light string of length \u2018l\u2019. A bullet of mass \u2018m\u2019 strikes the ball with velocity u and sticks. This type of collision we have already discussed in the previous chapter. The three important points in this collision are (i) Velocity of combined mass after collision (say v) can be obtained by conservation of linear momentum or p p f i = \u21d2 ( ) M m v mu + = or v mu M m = + (ii) Mechanical energy is lost only during collision. This loss is given by E E i f \u2212 (E = mechanical energy) = \u2212 + 1 2 1 2 2 2 mu M m v ( ) (iii) After collision now the mechanical energy remains constant and the combined mass executes vertical circular motion. If v gl \u2265 5 circle is completed. If 2 5 gl v gl < < , string slacks in upper half of the circle and if 0 2 < \u2264 v gl, combined mass oscillates in lower half of the circle. Type 2. A rod of mass M and length L is hinged at point O. A bullet of mass m moving with velocity u strikes the rod at its bottommost point and sticks. Just after collision the combined system (rod + bullet) starts rotating about the hinge point O with an angular speed \u03c9. 170 \u0097 Mechanics - II M O l m u \u21d2 M m + O v O \u21d2 M L m u O M \u03c9 m  So, the translational motion converts into rotational motion. The three important points in this collision are (i) At the time of collision, a linear impulse acts on the system at point O from the hinge. Angular impulse of this linear impulse about O is zero (as r\u22a5= 0). Therefore, angular momentum of the system about O remains constant or L L i f = \u2234 mur I \u22a5= \u03c9 or mu L I I = + ( ) rod Bullet \u03c9 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 ",

So, we can write : decrease in rotational kinetic energy = increase in gravitational potential energy. Type 3. A rod of mass M and length L is lying on a smooth table. A bullet of mass \u2018m\u2019 and speed \u2018u\u2019 strikes the rod at A and sticks.C1 is the centre of rod and C2 is the centre of mass of system (rod + bullet). Just after collision motion of the combined system is rotation (with angular velocity \u03c9) and translation (with linear velocity v). Thus, by the collision, translation motion converts into rotation plus translation motion. The three important points in this type of collision are: (i) System is kept over a smooth horizontal table. So, net linear impulse on the system is zero. Therefore, v can be obtained by conservation of linear momentum or, p p f i = \u21d2 ( ) M m v mu + = \u2234 v mu M m = + Since, net linear impulse on the system is zero. Therefore, angular impulse about any point is also zero. Hence, angular momentum of the system can be conserved about any point and\u03c9 can be obtained. But normally, we conserve it about point of impact (or A). Chapter 12 Rotational Mechanics \u0097 171 \u21d2 ",

The combination is pivoted at the lighter end, P as shown in figure. Such that it can freely rotate about point P in a vertical plane. A small object of mass 0.05 kg, moving horizontally, hits the lower end of the combination and sticks to it. What should be the velocity of the object, so that the system could just be raised to the horizontal position? (JEE 1994) Solution System is free to rotate but not free to translate. During collision, net torque on the system (rod A B m + + rod mass ) about point P is zero. Therefore, angular momentum of system before collision = angular momentum of system just after collision (about P).

(b) If both Assertion and Reason are true but Reason is not the correct explanation of Assertion. (c) If Assertion is true, but the Reason is false. (d) If Assertion is false but the Reason is true. 1. Assertion : Moment of inertia of a rigid body about any axis passing through its centre of mass is minimum. Reason : From theorem of parallel axis, I I Mr cm = + 2 2. Assertion : A ball is released on a rough ground in the condition shown in figure. It will start pure rolling after some time towards left side. Reason : Friction will convert the pure rotational motion of the ball into pure rolling. 3. Assertion : A solid sphere and a hollow sphere are rolling on ground with same total kinetic energies. If translational kinetic energy of solid sphere is K, then translational kinetic energy of hollow sphere should be greater than K. Reason : In case of hollow sphere rotational kinetic energy is less than its translational kinetic energy. 4. Assertion : A small ball is released from rest from point A as shown. If bowl is smooth, than ball will exert more pressure at point B, compared to the situation if bowl is rough. Reason : Linear velocity and hence, centripetal force in smooth situation is more. 5. Assertion : A cubical block is moving on a rough ground with velocity v0. During motion net normal reaction on the block from ground will not pass through centre of cube. It will shift towards right. Reason : It is to keep the block in rotational equilibrium. 6. Assertion : A ring is rolling without slipping on a rough ground. It strikes elastically with a smooth wall as shown in figure. Ring will stop after some time while travelling in opposite direction. Reason : After impact net angular momentum about an axis passing through bottommost point and perpendicular to plane of paper is zero. B A v0 Exercises  7. Assertion : There is a thin rod AB and a dotted line CD. All the axes we are talking about are perpendicular to plane of paper. As we take different axes moving from A to D, moment of inertia of the rod may first decrease then increase. Reason : Theorem of perpendicular axis cannot be applied here. 8. Assertion : If linear momentum of a particle is constant, then its angular momentum about any point will also remain constant. Reason : Linear momentum remains constant, if Fnet = 0 and angular momentum remains constant if \u03c4 net = 0. 9. Assertion : In the figure shown, A B , and C are three points on the circumference of a disc. Let v v A B , and vC are speeds of these three points, then v v v C B A > > Reason : In case of rotational plus translational motion of a rigid body, net speed of any point (other than centre of mass) is greater than, less than or equal to the speed of centre of mass. 10. Assertion : There is a triangular plate as shown. A dotted axis is lying in the plane of slab. As the axis is moved downwards, moment of inertia of slab will first decrease then increase. Reason : Axis is first moving towards its centre of mass and then it is receding from it. 11. Assertion : A horizontal force F is applied at the centre of solid sphere placed over a plank. The minimum coefficient of friction between plank and sphere required for pure rolling is \u00b51 when plank is kept at rest and \u00b5 2 when plank can move, then \u00b5 \u00b5 2 1 < .

Why do some earth satellites circle the earth in 90 minutes, while the moon takes 27 days for the trip? And why don\u2019t satellites fall back to earth? The study of gravitation provides the answers for these and many related questions. Gravitation is one of the four classes of interactions found in nature. These are : (i) the gravitational force (ii) the electromagnetic force (iii) the strong nuclear force (also called the hadronic forces) (iv) the weak nuclear forces. Although, of negligible importance in the interactions of elementary particles, gravity is of primary importance in the interactions of large objects. It is gravity that holds the universe together. In this chapter, we will learn the basic laws that govern gravitational interactions. 13.2 Newton's Law of Gravitation Along with his three laws of motion, Newton published the law of gravitation in 1687. According to him; \u201cevery particle of matter in the universe attracts every other particle with a force that is directly proportional to the product of the masses of the particles and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them.\u201d Thus, the magnitude of the gravitational force F between two particles m1 and m2 placed at a distance r is, F m m r \u221d 1 2 2 or F G m m r = 1 2 2 Here, G is a universal constant called gravitational constant whose magnitude is, G = \u00d7 6.67 10\u201311 N-m 2/kg 2 The direction of the force F is along the line joining the two particles. Following three points are important regarding the gravitational force : (i) Unlike the electrostatic force, it is independent of the medium between the particles. (ii) It is conservative in nature. (iii) It expresses the force between two point masses (of negligible volume). However, for external points of spherical bodies the whole mass can be assumed to be concentrated at its centre of mass. Gravity In Newton\u2019s law of gravitation, gravitation is the force of attraction between any two bodies. If one of the bodies is earth then the gravitation is called \u2018gravity\u2019. Hence, gravity is the force by which earth attracts a body towards its centre. It is a special case of gravitation. 210 \u0097 Mechanics - II  \u0098 Direct formula F Gm m r = 1 2 2 can be applied under following three conditions: (a) To find force between two point masses (b) To find force between two spherical bodies (c) To find force between a spherical body and a point mass. \u0098 To find force between a point mass and a rod single integration is required. In this case, we cannot assume whole mass of the rod at its centre to find force between them. Thus, F GMm r \u2260 2 \u0098 To find force between two rods double integration is required but normally, double integration is not asked in physics paper. \u0098 Two or more than two gravitational forces acting on a body can be added by vector addition method. V Example 13.1 Three point masses \u2018m\u2019 each are placed at the three vertices of an equilateral triangle of side \u2018a\u2019. Find net gravitational force on any one point mass. Solution We are finding net force on the point mass kept at O.

The mass of this sphere is, M M R R d \u2032 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u2212 4 3 4 3 3 3 / ( ) \u03c0 \u03c0 or M R d R M \u2032 = \u2212 ( ) . 3 3 F GM m R d GMm R d R = \u2032 \u2212 = \u2212 ( ) ( ) 2 3 and g F m \u2032 = Substituting the values, we get g g d R \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 i.e. g g \u2032 < Note We can see from this equation that g\u2032 = 0 at d R = , i.e. acceleration due to gravity is zero at the centre of the earth. Thus, the variation in the value of g with r (the distance from the centre of earth) is as shown in Fig. 13.18. For r R \u2264 , g g d R gr R \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= 1 as R d r \u2212 = or g r \u2032 \u221d For r R \u2265 , g g d R \u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 2 = gR r 2 2 as R d r + = or g r \u2032 \u221d1 2 216 \u0097 Mechanics - II R O d m Fig. 13.17 g \u2032 g g r \u2032\u221d r = R r g\u2032\u221d1 r 2 Fig. 13.18  Axial Rotation of the Earth Let us consider a particle P at rest on the surface of the earth, at latitude \u03c6. Then the pseudo force acting on the particle is mr\u03c92 in outward direction. The true acceleration g is acting towards the centre O of the earth. Thus, the effective acceleration g\u2032 is the resultant of g and r\u03c92 or g g r g r \u2032 = + + \u00b0 \u2212\u03c6 2 2 2 2 2 180 ( ) ( ) cos ( ) \u03c9 \u03c9 as angle between g and r\u03c92 is ( ) 180\u00b0 \u2212\u03c6 . or g g r gr \u2032 = + \u2212 \u03c6 2 2 4 2 2 \u03c9 \u03c9 cos \u2026(i) Here, the term r 2 4 \u03c9 comes out to be too small as \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c0 = = \u00d7 2 2 24 3600 T rad/s is small. Hence, this term can be ignored. Also, r R = \u03c6 cos . Therefore, Eq. (i) can be written as g g gR \u2032 = \u2212 \u03c6 ( cos ) / 2 2 2 1 2 2 \u03c9 = \u2212 \u03c6 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 g R g 1 2 2 2 1 2 \u03c9 cos / \u2248 \u2212 \u03c6 \uf8eb \uf8ed \uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8 \uf8f7 g R g 1 2 2 \u03c9 cos Thus, g g R \u2032 = \u2212 \u03c6 \u03c92 2 cos Following conclusions can be drawn from the above discussion : (i) The effective value of g is not truly vertical passing through the centre O. (ii) The effect of centrifugal force due to rotation of earth is to reduce the effective value of g. (iii) At equator \u03c6 = \u00b0 0 . Therefore, g g R \u2032 = \u2212 \u03c92 and at poles \u03c6 = \u00b0 90 , Therefore, g g \u2032 = Thus, at equator g\u2032 is minimum while at poles g\u2032 is maximum.

At what new time period will the weight of a body on the equator becomes zero? Take g m s = 10 2 / and radius of earth R km = 6400 . Solution The weight will become zero, when g\u2032 = 0 or g R \u2212 = \u03c9 2 0 (on the equator g g R \u2032 = \u2212 \u03c9 2) or \u03c9 = g R \u2234 2\u03c0 T g R = or T R g = 2\u03c0 Substituting the values, T = \u00d7 2 6400 10 10 3600 3 \u03c0 h or T = 1.4 h Ans. Thus, the new time period should be 1.4 h instead of 24 h for the weight of a body to be zero on the equator. V Example 13.9 Draw g\u2032 versus d and g\u2032 versus h graph. Here, \u2018d\u2019 is depth below the surface of earth and h is the height from the surface of earth. Solution On the surface of earth, g g \u2032 = At depth \u2018d\u2019 below the surface of earth, g g d R \u2032 = \u2212 \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 i.e. g\u2032 decreases linearly with depth. At, d R = , g\u2032 = 0 At height h above the surface of earth. g g h R \u2032 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 2 With increase in the value of \u2018h\u2019 value of g\u2032 decreases but not linearly. At h\u2192\u221e, g\u2032\u21920.

From the graph we can see that value of g\u2032 at depth d R = 3 4 and height h R = are same. 1. Value of g on the surface of earth is 9.8 m s/ 2. Find its value on the surface of a planet whose mass and radius both are two times that of earth. 2. Value of g on the surface of earth is 9.8 m s/ 2. Find its value (a) at height h R = from the surface, (b) at depth d R = 2 from the surface. (R = radius of earth) 3. Calculate the distance from the surface of the earth at which the acceleration due to gravity is the same below and above the surface of the earth. 4. Calculate the change in the value of g at altitude 45\u00b0. Take radius of earth R = \u00d7 637 103 . km. 5. At what height from the surface of earth will the value of g be reduced by 36% from the value at the surface? Take radius of earth R = 6400 km. 6. Determine the speed with which the earth would have to rotate on its axis, so that a person on the equator would weigh 3 5 th as much as at present. Take R = 6400 km. 7. A body is weighed by a spring balance to be 1000 N at the north pole. How much will it weight at the equator? Account for the earth\u2019s rotation only. 8. At what rate should the earth rotate so that the apparent g at the equator becomes zero ? What will be the length of the day in this situation? 9.

When this test mass is moved from one point to another point, some work is also done by this gravitational force. Mathematically, gravitational field at any point can be defined by two physical quantities. One is vector quantity, called gravitational field strength or intensity of gravitational field and it is denoted by E. This is related to the gravitational force (a vector quantity) experienced by test mass in gravitational field. We also sometimes called it gravitational field. The other physical quantity is gravitational potential. It is represented by V. This is related to the work done (a scalar quantity) by gravitational force in moving the test mass from one point to another point in the gravitational field. Gravitational Field Strength (E) The force experienced (both in magnitude and direction) by a unit test mass placed at a point in a gravitational field is called the gravitational field strength or intensity of gravitational field at that point. Thus, E F = m SI unit of E is N/kg. Note The test mass to find field strength at some point should be infinitesimally small otherwise it will produce its own field and will disturb the original field. In Article 13.3, we have seen that acceleration due to gravity g is also F m . Hence, for the earth\u2019s gravitational field g and Eare same. The E versus r (the distance from the centre of earth) graph are same as that of g\u2032 versus r graph. Field due to a Point Mass Suppose, a point mass M is placed at point O. We want to find the intensity of gravitational field Eat a point P, a distance r from O. Magnitude of force F acting on a particle of mass m placed at P is, F GMm r = 2 \u2234 E F m = or E ",

So, they are functions of position. In cartesian co-ordinate system position of a point can be represented by three variable co-ordinates x, y and z. So, Eand V are functions of three variables x, y and z. But in physics, we normally try to keep least number of variables. So, in one dimension (say along x-axis) position of a point can be represented by a single variable co-ordinates x. So, E and V are functions of only one variable x. Similarly, in case of point mass or spherical bodies this single variable is r. Where r is the distance from point mass or distance from the centre of the spherical body. Further, E and V are not two independent functions, but they are related to each other either by differentiation or integration.

The word potential energy is defined only for a conservative force field. There we have discussed that the change in potential energy ( ) dU of a system corresponding to a conservative force is given by dU d = \u2212 \u22c5 F r or dU d i f i f \u222b \u222b = \u2212 \u22c5 F r r r or U U d f i i f \u2212 = \u2212 \u22c5 \u222b F r r r We generally choose the reference point at infinity and assume potential energy to be zero there, i.e. if we take ri = \u221e(infinite) andU i = 0, then we can write U d W = \u2212 \u22c5 = \u2212 \u221e\u222bF r r or potential energy of a body or system is negative of work done by the conservative forces in bringing it from infinity to the present position. Gravitational Potential Energy of a two Particle System The gravitational potential energy of two particles of masses m1 and m2 separated by a distance r is given by, U Gm m r = \u2212 1 2 This is actually the negative of work done in bringing those masses from infinity to a distance r by the gravitational forces between them. Gravitational Potential Energy for a System of Particles The gravitational potential energy for a system of particles (say m1, m2, m3 and m4) is given by U G m m r m m r m m r m m r m m r m m r = \u2212 + + + + + 4 3 43 4 2 42 4 1 41 3 2 32 3 1 31 2 1 21 \uf8ee \uf8f0\uf8ef \uf8f9 \uf8fb\uf8fa Thus, for a n particle system there are n n ( ) \u22121 2 pairs and the potential energy is calculated for each pair and added to get the total potential energy of the system. Gravitational Potential Energy of a Body on Earth\u2019s Surface The gravitational potential energy of mass m in the gravitational field of mass M at a distance r from it is, U GMm r = \u2212 The earth behaves for all external points as if its mass M were concentrated at its centre. Therefore, a mass m near earth\u2019s surface may be considered at a distance R (the radius of earth) from M.

Find the initial speed of the particle. 234 \u0097 Mechanics - II INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 13.5  13.8 Binding Energy Total mechanical energy (potential + kinetic) of a closed system is negative. The modulus of this total mechanical energy is known as the binding energy of the system. This is the energy due to which system is closed or different parts of the system are bound to each other. Suppose the mass m is placed on the surface of earth. The radius of the earth is R and its mass is M. Then, the kinetic energy of the particle K = 0 and the potential energy is U GMm R = \u2212 . Therefore, the total mechanical energy is, E K U GMm R = + = \u2212 0 or E GMm R = \u2212 \u2234 Binding energy = = | | E GMm R It is due to this energy, the particle is attached with the earth. If minimum this much energy is given to the particle in any form (normally kinetic) the particle no longer remains attached to the earth. It goes out of the gravitational field of earth. Escape Velocity As we discussed above, the binding energy of a particle on the surface of earth kept at rest is GMm R .If this much energy in the form of kinetic energy is supplied to the particle, it leaves the gravitational field of the earth. So, if ve is the escape velocity of the particle, then 1 2 2 mv GMm R e = or v ",

On the surface of earth its value is 11.2 km/s. Chapter 13 Gravitation \u0097 235 m R M Fig. 13.45  \u0098 The value of escape velocity is 11.2 km/s from the surface of earth. From some height above the surface of earth this value will be less than 11.2 km/s. \u0098 Escape velocity is independent of the direction in which it is projected. In the figure shown, body is given 11.2 km/s along three different paths. In each case, it will escape to infinity, but following different paths. For example, along path-1 it will follow a straight line. \u0098 If velocity of a particle is ve , then its total mechanical energy is zero. As the particle moves towards infinity its kinetic energy decreases and potential energy increases, but total mechanical energy remains constant. At any point E K U = + = 0 \u21d2 K U = \u2212 For example, if K =100J on the surface of earth then U = \u2212100J. At some height suppose K becomes 60 J, then U will become \u221260J. At infinity K = 0. So U is also zero. Hence, speed at infinity will be zero. \u0098 If velocity of the particle is less than ve then total mechanical energy is negative and it does not escape to infinity. \u0098 If velocity of the particle is more than ve then total mechanical energy is positive.

Such satellites are used for telecommunication, weather forecast and other applications. The path of these satellites are elliptical with the centre of earth at a focus. However the difference in major and minor axes is so small that they can be treated as nearly circular for not too sophisticated calculations. Let us derive certain characteristics of the motion of satellites by assuming the orbit to be perfectly circular.

(R = 6400 km, g = 10m s/ 2) 13.10 Kepler's Laws of Planetary Motion Kepler discovered three empirical laws that accurately described the motion of the planets. The three laws may be stated as, (i) Each planet moves in an elliptical orbit, with the sun at one focus of the ellipse. This law is also known as the law of elliptical orbits and obviously gives the shape of the orbits of the planets round the sun. (ii) The radius vector, drawn from the sun to a planet, sweeps out equal areas in equal time, i.e. its areal velocity (or the area swept out by it per unit time) is constant. This is referred to as the law of areas and gives the relationship between the orbital speed of the planet and its distance from the sun. (iii) The square of the planet\u2019s time period is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis of its orbit. This is known as the law of time period and gives the relationship between the size of the orbit of a planet and its time of revolution. Chapter 13 Gravitation \u0097 241 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 13.7  Kepler did not know why the planets move in this way. Three generations later when Newton turned his attention to the motion of the planets, he discovered that each of Kepler\u2019s laws can be derived. They are consequences of Newton\u2019s law of motion and the law of gravitation. Let us first consider the elliptical orbits described in Kepler\u2019s first law. Figure shows the geometry of the ellipse. The longest dimension is the major axis with half length a. This half length is called the semi-major axis. ",

        "content": "+ \u2032 = constant Here, S and S\u2032 are the foci and P any point on the ellipse. The sun is at S and planet at P. The distance of each focus from the centre of ellipse is ea, where e is the dimensionless number between 0 to 1 called the eccentricity. If e = 0,the ellipse is a circle. The actual orbits of the planets are nearly circular, their eccentricities range from 0.007 for Venus to 0.248 for Pluto. For earth e = 0.017. The point in the planet\u2019s orbit closest to the sun is the perihelion and the point most distant from the sun is aphelion. Explanation of First Law Newton was able to show that for a body acted on by an attractive force proportional to 1 2 r , the only possible closed orbits are a circle or an ellipse. The open orbits must be parabolas or hyperbolas. He also showed that if total energy E is negative the orbit is an ellipse (or circle), if it is zero the orbit is a parabola and if E is positive the orbit is a hyperbola. Further, it was also shown that the orbits under the attractive force F K r n = , are stable for n < 3.Therefore, it follows that circular orbits will be stable for a force varying inversely as the distance or the square of the distance and will be unstable for the inverse cube (or a higher power) law.

        "content": "= 1 2 ( ) ( sin ) r v dt \u03b8 \u2234 Areal velocity dA dt rv = 1 2 sin \u03b8 \u2026(i) Now, rv sin \u03b8 is the magnitude of the vector product r v \u00d7 which in turn is 1 m times the angular momentum L r v = \u00d7 m of the planet with respect to the sun. So we have, dA dt m m L m = \u00d7 = 1 2 2 | | r v \u2026(ii) or dA dt L m = = 2 constant Thus, Kepler\u2019s second law, that areal velocity is constant, means that angular momentum is constant. It is easy to see why the angular momentum of the planet must be constant. According to Newton\u2019s law the rate of change of L equals the torque of the gravitational force F acting on the planet, d dt L r F = \u00d7 = \u03c4 Here, r is the radius vector of planet from the centre of the sun and the force F is directed from the planet towards the centre of the sun. So, these vectors always lie along the same line and their vector product r F \u00d7 is zero. Hence, d dt L = 0 or L = constant. Thus, from Eq. (ii) we can see that dA dt = constant if L = constant. Thus, second law is actually the law of conservation of angular momentum. Explanation of Third Law In Article 13.9 we have already derived Kepler\u2019s third law for the particular case of circular orbits ( ) T r 2 3 \u221d . Newton was able to show that the same relationship holds for an elliptical orbit, with the orbit radius r replaced by semimajor axis a. Thus, T a GM s = 2 3 2 \u03c0 / (elliptical orbit) Here, M s is the mass of the sun. Chapter 13 Gravitation \u0097 243  Extra Points to Remember \u0098 Most of the problems of planetary motion are solved by two conservation laws: (i) conservation of angular momentum about centre of the sun and (ii) conservation of mechanical (potential + kinetic) energy Hence, the following two equations are used in most of the cases, mvr sin \u03b8 = constant \u2026(i) 1 2 2 mv GMm r \u2212 = constant \u2026(ii) At aphelion (or M) and perihelion (or N) positions \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 Hence, Eq. (i) can be written as, mvr sin 90\u00b0 =constant or mvr = constant \u2026(iii) Further, since mass of the planet ( ) m also remains constant, Eq. (i) can also be written as vr sin \u03b8 =constant \u2026(iv) or v r v r 11 2 2 = ( ) \u03b8 = \u00b0 90 r r 1 2 > \u2234 v v 1 2 < V Example 13.29 Name the physical quantities which remain constant in a planetary motion (in elliptical orbits). Solution Angular momentum about centre of sun and mechanical energy. V Example 13.30 Consider a planet moving in an elliptical orbit round the sun. The work done on the planet by the gravitational force of the sun is zero in any small part of the orbit. Is this statement true or false ? Solution False, only at aphelion and perihelion positions F is perpendicular to dS. So, at these two positions work done by gravitational force is zero. At other points angle between F and dS is not 90\u00b0. So, work done is not zero. But, being a conservative force work done in a closed path (or in one full rotation) is zero. 244 \u0097 Mechanics - II q v P r S v1 r2 S v2 90\u00b0 r1 90\u00b0 N M Fig. 13.51  Final Touch Points Polar and Geostationary Satellites 1. Satellites in low polar orbit pass over the poles. They orbit between 100 km and 200 km above the Earth's surface, taking around 90 minutes to make each orbit. The earth spins beneath the satellites as it moves, so the satellite can scan the whole surface of the earth. Low orbit polar satellites have uses such as \u2022 Monitoring the weather. \u2022 Observing the earth's surface. \u2022 Military uses including spying. 2. Geostationary satellites have a different trajectory to polar satellites. They are in orbit above the equator from west to east. The height of their orbit-36,000 km is just the right distance so that it takes them one day (24 hours) to make each orbit. This means that they stay in a fixed position over the earth's surface. A single geostationary satellite is on a line sight with about 40 percent of the earth's surface. Three such satellites, each separated by 120 degrees of longitude, can provide coverage of the entire planet. Geostationary satellites have uses such as: \u2022 communications- including satellites phones \u2022 global positioning or GPS. Geostationary satellites always appear in the same position when seen from the ground. This is why satellite television dishes can be bolted into one position and do not need to move. 3.

Concept Two particles (or two spherical bodies) of masses m1 and m2 are free to move along the line joining them. This time their masses are comparable. Net force on the two particle system is zero.Therefore, linear momentum of the system may be conserved. Further, gravitational forces are conservative in nature. Therefore, mechanical energy of the system is also conserved. Since, we are using two conservation laws, therefore number of unknowns are also two.

Hence, the sphere of mass M is at rest and only the particle of mass \u2018m\u2019 will move. This particle is projected with velocity v at some angle \u03b8 from the surface as shown. Gravitational force on \u2018m\u2019 is always towards centre of \u2018M\u2019. So, its torque about centre is always zero and angular momentum of particle about centre may be conserved. Further, the gravitational force, being a conservative force mechanical energy can also be conserved. We are applying two conservation laws, so number of unknown are also two. V Example 9 Find the maximum and minimum distances of the planet A from the sun S, if at a certain moment of time it was at a distance r0 and travelling with the velocity v0, with the angle between the radius vector and velocity vector being equal to \u03c6. Solution At minimum and maximum distances velocity vector ( ) v makes an angle of 90\u00b0 with radius vector. Hence, from conservation of angular momentum, mv r mrv 0 0 sin \u03c6 = \u2026(i) Here, m is the mass of the planet.

Concept Suppose the particle of mass \u2018m\u2019 is projected from the surface of planet of mass M1 and we wish to project it upto the surface of other planet. In between the two planets, there is a point P, where net field strength is zero. Or, net force on \u2018m\u2019 is zero.

BetweenC2 and P field strengths of M 2 is stronger and net force on \u2018m\u2019 is towards C2. So, we have to project the particle only upto P. After P, it automatically moves towards the surface of B by the attraction of M 2. How to Solve? First find the point P, where net gravitational force on \u2018m\u2019 is zero. Then, apply energy conservation equation between A and P where, vA = minimum velocity required and vPis tending to zero.

In general, motion of a body (or its path) depends on two factors: (i) the nature of force (or acceleration) of the body and (ii) its velocity For example A constant force or constant acceleration always gives a straight line or parabolic path. If initial velocity is zero or parallel (or antiparallel) to constant acceleration then path is straight line. In all other cases, path is a parabola. For small height, acceleration due to gravity ( ) a g = is constant. So, path is either straight line or parabola. If force of constant magnitude is acting on a particle and its direction is always perpendicular to velocity, then path is circular motion in which speed is constant. This is also called uniform circular motion. F F F F 1 2 3 4 2 = = = = mv R = centripetal force v v v v 1 2 3 4 = = = = v = speed of the particle. Now let us consider a particle free to move along x-axis, which is being acted upon by a force given by, F kx n = \u2212 Here, k is a positive constant. Now, following cases are possible depending on the value of n : (i) If n is an even integer (0, 2, 4, \u2026 etc), force is always along negative x-axis. If the particle is released from any position on the x-axis (except at x = 0) a force in negative direction of x-axis acts on it and it moves rectilinearly along negative x-axis. (ii) If n is an odd integer (1, 3, 5, \u2026 etc), force is along negative x-axis for x > 0, along positive x-axis for x < 0 and zero for x = 0. Thus, the particle will oscillate about stable equilibrium position (also called the mean position), x = 0. The force in this case is called the restoring force. Of these, if n =1, i.e. F kx = \u2212 the motion is said to be SHM. 2. In every oscillatory motion, there is one mean position (or stable equilibrium position) and two extreme positions. 3. Distance between mean position and the extreme position is called amplitude of oscillation A. 286 \u0097 Mechanics - II u g u g g u = 0 u Fig. 14.1 ",

In this displacement F kx = \u2212 type force opposes the motion. So, work has to be done against this force which remains stored in the system in the form of mechanical energy. In the absence of any dissipative forces (like friction or viscous force) this mechanical energy remains constant. While moving from extreme positions to mean position potential energy decreases and kinetic energy increases but total mechanical energy remains constant. Similarly, in moving from mean position to extreme positions potential energy increases and kinetic energy decreases. 5. The more the initial displacement from the mean position, more is the amplitude, more is the initial work done and more is the mechanical energy given for oscillations. 6. Like any other motion, SHM is also a motion. So, basic characteristics of any motion (like v s = d dt, a v = d dt etc.) can also be applied to SHM. 7. In most of the motions, displacement of the particle is measured from the starting point ( ) t =0 . But in SHM displacement is normally measured from the mean position and it is denoted by x (or y). 8. At mean position, x =0, F =0, a =0 v =maximum, kinetic energy = maximumand potential energy is minimum(not necessarily zero) At extreme positions, x A = \u00b1 , F = maximum, a = maximum, kinetic energy =0 and potential energy = maximum. 9. SHM is called simple harmonic motion because its mathematics is simple. Mathematics of periodic motion of higher powers (n = 3, 5, 7 etc in F kx n = \u2212 ) is slightly complex. This is the reason, we study only simple harmonic oscillatory motion at this stage. 10. In SHM, we shall discuss x, A, v, a, F, K, U, E, T, f and \u03c9. Here, x = displacement from the mean position A = amplitude of oscillations v = velocity (or speed) a = acceleration F = force K = kinetic energy U = potential energy E = total mechanical energy T = time period of oscillations f = frequency of oscillations and \u03c9 = angular frequency of oscillations. 11. SHM may be linear or angular. For example, motion of a pendulum for small amplitudes is angular SHM and motion of spring block system is linear SHM. 12. Like any other motion, equations of SHM can be written in terms of its displacement (v u as 2 2 2 = + ) or time (v u at = + ). The only difference is, in most of the equations of SHM \u2018x\u2019 is measured from the mean position. Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 287  14.2 Displacement Equations of SHM In most of the equations of SHM displacement will be represented by x, where x = displacement from the mean position. Force Equation As we have discussed earlier also, F Kx = \u2212 is the force required for a particle to execute SHM. This type of force is obtained when a block is attached with a spring. Therefore, motion of block with a spring is always SHM. Following are given some important points in this equation : (i) x varies between + A and \u2212A (ii) F x - graph is a straight line passing through x =0or the mean position (not necessarily the origin) At x A = \u00b1 , F ",

Further, magnitude of force is proportional to magnitude of x. It means magnitude of force varies linearly with magnitude of x. If magnitude of x is doubled then magnitude of force will also become two times.

Later we will see that most of the equations of SHM can be derived from uniform circular motion. Angular frequency of SHM is similar to angular speed \u03c9 of uniform circular motion. At both places we can find time period T and frequency f from \u03c9. \u03c9 \u03c0 = = K m T 2 \u2234 T m K =2\u03c0 (in SHM) (ii) a x - graph is a straight line passing through x =0 or the mean position. tan\u03b2 \u03c9 = = \u2212 Slope 2 \u21d2 At x A = \u00b1 , a A = m \u03c92 (iii) a =0 at x =0, or at the mean position.

(ii) v =0 at x A = \u00b1 or at extreme positions. (iii) v A = \u00b1\u03c9 or v A max =\u03c9 at x =0, or at the mean position. (iv) For upper half of the ellipse velocity is positive (when the body is moving from \u2212A to +A). For lower half of the ellipse velocity is negative (when the body is moving from +A to \u2212A). (v) At mean position (or x =0), velocity is +\u03c9A when the body is moving towards +A and velocity is \u2212\u03c9A when the body is moving towards \u2212A. Energy Equations Total Mechanical Energy As we have discussed earlier also, at mean position potential energy is minimum (say U 0). This minimum potential energyU 0 may be zero, positive or negative. If not given in the question then we will take is zero. Now, suppose W is the work done in displacing the body from x =0 to x A = . Then, total mechanical energy is now E W U = + 0. Let us start with an example of spring-block system kept at height h, so that the block has already a potential energy, U mgh 0 = at mean position or natural length of spring where F =0. Now, the block is displaced upto x A = . Work done (by external agent) in this displacement (against the spring force \u2212kx) is W ",

Can we use the equationv u at = + in SHM or not ? 14.3 Time Equations of SHM In one dimensional motion, if acceleration as a function of time is given, then by integrating a t- equation we can make v t- equation. By further integrating v t- equation we can make s t- or x t- equation. Meaning of General Solution In one dimensional motion, if a = constant then general solution of v t- equation is (which can be obtained by integrating a t- equation) v u at = + In this equation, u and a are constants but v and t are variables. In different problems, values of these constants u and a are different but basic nature of all v t- equations are same. Here, the basic nature is linear equation in v and t or straight line graph between v and t. Standard Differential Equation of SHM In article 14.2, we have seen that a x - equation of SHM is a x = \u2212\u03c92 This equation can also be written as d x dt x 2 2 2 = \u2212\u03c9 \u2026(i) Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 295 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 14.1  This is standard second order differential equation of SHM. Solving this differential equation we can find x t- equation. But normally we do not solve a differential equation in physics at this stage. So, we can directly write general solution of Eq. (i). The general solution of Eq. (i) is x A t = \u00b1 sin ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 or x A t = \u00b1 cos ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 In these equations x and t are variables. But A, \u03c9 and \u03c6 are constants. In different problems, values of these constants are different but basic nature of all equations will be same. Here, the basic nature is sinusoidal (sine or cosine) x t- equation and x t- graph. By differentiating x t- equation we can also make other equations. For example, if x A t = \u00b1 sin ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 Then v dx dt A t = = \u00b1 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c6 cos( ) and, a dv dt A t = = \u2212 \u00b1 \u03c9 \u03c9 \u03c6 2 sin( ) = \u2212\u03c92 x [as A t x sin( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 \u00b1 = ] Time Period (T ) and Frequency (f ) In the above equations, time period of oscillations is T = 2\u03c0 \u03c9 and frequency of oscillation is f T = = 1 2 \u03c9 \u03c0 Phase Angle at Time t In any trigonometric function its angle is very important. The value of function varies with this angle. For example, suppose we have a trigonometric function. y = sin\u03b8 then, y = 0 for \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 , y= 1 2 for \u03b8 = \u00b0 30 So, value of y depends on the angle \u03b8. This angle is called the phase angle. In x t- , v t- and a t- equations of SHM we have seen above that the phase angle is same, ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 t \u00b1 . This may be called the phase angle of x t- , v t- and a t- equations at time t. With the help of this angle values of x, v and a can be obtained at any time t. Here, x varies between +A and \u2212A, v varies between +\u03c9A and \u2212\u03c9A and a varies between +\u03c92 A and \u2212\u03c92 A. If ( ) \u03c9 \u03c6 t \u00b1 is 30\u00b0 at some instant, then according to above equations values of x, v and a are + A 2, + 3 2 \u03c9A and \u2212\u03c92 2 A. This condition is shown in following figure: x A v A a A = + = + = \u2212 2 3 2 2 2 , \u03c9 \u03c9 and 296 \u0097 Mechanics - II \u2013A x v +A O a Fig. 14.10  Initial Phase Angle In the phase angle \u03c9 \u03c6 t \u00b1 if we substitute t =0, then the angle is \u00b1\u03c6. This is called initial phase angle. With the help of initial phase angle we can determine initial values of x, v and a. Dependence of Initial Phase Angle Initial phase angle depends on following three factors : (i) Whether we write sine equation or cosine equation. (ii) Initial value of x (at t =0) (iii) Initial direction of velocity. For example, in first figure the body starts (t =0, u\u22600) from x A = + 2 with velocity v A 1 3 2 = \u03c9 and the initial phase angle is suppose \u03c61 (corresponding to sine equation) In second figure, body starts from the same point x A = + 2 but direction of velocity is opposite or v A 2 3 2 = \u2212 \u03c9 and the initial phase angle is suppose \u03c6 2 (corresponding to sine equation). Then \u03c6 \u03c6 1 2 \u2260 Similarly, if we wish to write cosine equations and their initial phase angles are suppose \u03c61\u2032 and\u03c6 2\u2032 , then \u03c6 \u03c6 1 1 \u2260 \u2032 and \u03c6 \u03c6 2 2 \u2260 \u2032 Four Frequently used x t- Equations Between + Aand \u2212Athere may be infinite number of points from where the body may start its journey (t =0 but u is zero only if, it starts from + A or \u2212A). Further at every point (except at + A and \u2212A) two directions (positive x or negative x) of initial velocity can exist. So, infinite number of initial phase angles are possible or infinite number of x t- equations can be written. But following four initial conditions ( ) t =0 and corresponding four x t - equations are frequently used.

(b) Position, (c) velocity and (d) acceleration  Restoring Force or Torque Method The following steps are usually followed in this method: Step 1 Find the stable equilibrium position which usually is also known as the mean position. Net force or  torque on the particle in this position is zero. Potential energy is minimum. Step 2 Displace the body from its mean position by a small displacement x (in case of a linear SHM) or \u03b8 (in case of an angular SHM). Step 3 Find net force or torque in this displaced position. Step 4 Show that this force or torque has a tendency to bring the body back to its mean position and magnitude of force or torque is proportional to displacement, i.e. F x \u221d\u2212 or F Kx = \u2212 \u2026(i) or \u03c4 \u03b8 \u221d\u2212 or \u03c4 \u03b8 = \u2212K \u2026(ii) This force or torque is also known as restoring force or  restoring torque. Step 5 Find linear acceleration by dividing Eq. (i) by mass m or angular acceleration by dividing Eq. (ii) by moment of inertia I.

Find the total mechanical energy ( ) E in the displaced position. Since, mechanical energy in SHM remains constant. dE dt = 0 By differentiating the energy equation with respect to time and substituting dx dt v = , d dt \u03b8 \u03c9 = , dv dt a = , and d dt \u03c9 \u03b1 = we come to step-5 or we directly get F x \u2212 and a x \u2212 equations (or\u03c4 \u03b8 \u2212 or x \u2212\u03b8 equation). The remaining procedure is same. Note (i) E usually consists of following terms : (a) Gravitational PE (b) Elastic PE (c) Electrostatic PE (d) Rotational KE and  (e) Translational KE (ii) For gravitational PE, choose the reference point ( ) h = 0 at mean position. Now, let us take few examples of finding time period ( ) T of certain simple harmonic motions. 306 \u0097 Mechanics - II  The Simple Pendulum An example of SHM is the motion of a pendulum. A simple pendulum is defined as a particle of mass m suspended from a point O by a string of length l and of negligible mass. When the particle is pulled aside to position B, so that the string makes an angle \u03b8 0 with the vertical OC and then released, the pendulum will oscillate between B and the symmetric position B\u2032. The oscillatory motion is due to the tangential component FT of the weight mg of the particle. This force FT is maximum at B and B\u2032 and zero at C. Thus, we can write, F mg T = \u2212 sin \u03b8 Here, minus sign appears because it is opposite to the displacement. x ",

Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 313 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 14.4  Final Touch Points 1. Simple Pendulum (i) Time periodT l g = 2\u03c0 is applicable only for small oscillations. (ii) If the time period of a simple pendulum is 2 s, it is called seconds pendulum. Length of this pendulum is 1 m. (iii) If length of the pendulum is large, g no longer remains vertical but will be directed towards the centre of the earth and expression for time period is given by, T g l R = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 1 1 1 \u03c0 Here, R is the radius of earth. From this expression we can see that, (a) if l R << , 1 1 l R >> andT l g = 2\u03c0 (b) as l \u2192\u221e,1 0 l \u2192 andT R g = 2\u03c0 and substituting the value of R and g, we getT = 84.6 min. (iv) Time period of a simple pendulum depends on acceleration due to gravity \u2018 \u2019 g as T g \u221d \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 so take | | geff inT l g = 2\u03c0 . Following two cases are possible : (a) If a simple pendulum is in a carriage which is accelerating with accelerationa, then g g a eff = \u2212 e.g. if the acceleration a is upwards, then | | geff = + g a and T l g a = + 2\u03c0 If the acceleration a is downwards, then ( ) with g a > | | geff = \u2212 g a and T l g a = \u2212 2\u03c0 If the acceleration a is in horizontal direction, then | | geff = + a g 2 2 In a freely falling lift geff = 0 andT = \u221ei.e. the pendulum will not oscillate. (b) If in addition to gravity one additional force F, (e.g. electrostatic force Fe) is also acting on the bob, then in that case, g g F eff = + m Here, m is the mass of the bob. (v) Due to change in temperature, length of pendulum and so the time period will change. If \u2206\u03b8 is the increase in temperature then, l l \u2032 = + ( ) 1 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u2206 or l l \u2032 = + 1 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u2206 \u2234 T T l l \u2032 = \u2032 = + ( ) / 1 1 2 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u2206 \u2248 + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 1 2 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u2206 314 \u0097 Mechanics - II  \u2234 T T \u2032 \u2212 \u2248 1 1 2 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u2206 or T T T \u2032 \u2212 = 1 2 \u03b1 \u03b8 \u2206 or \u2206 \u2206 T T = 1 2 \u03b1 \u03b8 Note In case of a pendulum clock, time is lost if T increases and gained if T decreases. Time lost or gained in time t is given by, \u2206 \u2206 t T T t = \u2032 . e.g. if T s = 2 ,T s \u2032 = 3 , then \u2206T s = 1 \u2234Time lost by the clock in 1 h. \u2206t s = \u00d7 = 1 3 3600 1200 (vi) Above the surface of earth, blow the surface of earth, in moving from pole to equator and on moon value of g decreases, therefore time period of pendulum will increase. 2. Spring-block System (i) In all three figures shown above, restoring force in displaced position is F kx = \u2212 . Therefore, time period is, T m K = 2\u03c0 The only difference is, their mean positions are different. In the first figure, mean position is at the natural length of spring. In the second figure, mean position is obtained after an extension of x mg K 0 = (as kx mg 0 = ) and in the third figure after an extension of x mg K 0 = sin\u03b8. (ii) In case of a vertical spring-block system, time period can also be written as, T l g = 2\u03c0 Here, l = extension in the spring when the mass m is suspended from the spring. This can be seen as under : kl mg = (in equilibrium position) \u2234 m k l g = or T m k l g = = 2 2 \u03c0 \u03c0 Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 315 m K (b) m K (a) K \u03b8 smooth (c) m m  (iii) Equivalent force constant (k) If a spring block system is constructed by using two springs and a mass, the following three situations are possible: Refer Fig. (a) In this case, 1 1 1 1 2 k k k = + or k k k k k = + 1 2 1 2 \u2234 T m k m k k k k = = + 2 2 1 2 1 2 \u03c0 \u03c0 ( ) Fig. (b) and (c) In both the cases, k k k = + 1 2 or T m k m k k = = + 2 2 1 2 \u03c0 \u03c0 (iv) If spring has a mass ms and a mass m is suspended from it, then time period is given by, T m m k s = + 2 3 \u03c0 (v) If the spring connected with two masses m1 and m2 is compressed or elongated by x 0 and then left for oscillations then both blocks execute SHM with same time period (and therefore same frequency) but different amplitudes. This time period is T K = 2\u03c0 \u00b5 Here, \u00b5 is called their reduced mass given by 1 1 1 1 2 \u00b5 = + m m or \u00b5 = + m m m m 1 2 1 2 Their  amplitudes of oscillations are in inverse ratio of their masses or A m \u221d1 \u21d2 A A m m 1 2 2 1 = \u21d2 A m m m x 1 2 1 2 0 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 and A m m m x 2 1 1 2 0 = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 Note If m m 1 2 >> , then 1 1 1 2 m m << \u2234 1 1 2 \u00b5 \u2248m or \u00b5 \u2248m2 and T m K =2 2 \u03c0 So, in this case we can understand that m1 is almost stationary. Only m2 will oscillate. 316 \u0097 Mechanics - II m2 K m1 smooth m2 m1 m m m k1 k2 k1 k2 k1 k2 (a) (b) (c)  (vi) The force constant( ) k of a spring is inversely proportional to the length of the spring. i.e. k \u221d 1 length of spring This can be visualized as: A spring of length l and spring constant k can be supposed to be made up by two springs in series, of length l 2 and force constant 2k.In series, k k k k k k k k k k eff = + = + = 1 2 1 2 2 2 2 2 ( ) ( ) 3. Oscillations of a fluid column Initially the level of liquid in both the columns is same. The area of cross-section of the tube is uniform. If the liquid is depressed by x in one limb, it will rise by x along the length of the tube is the other limb. Here, the restoring force is provided by the hydrostatic pressure difference. \u2234 F ",

(i) Time period of a simple pendulum for small oscillations. (ii) Time period of a spring-block system in vertical position. (iii) Time period of a liquid column in a U-tube filled to a height l. But l has different meanings at different places. 4. Lissajous figures Suppose two forces act on a particle, the first alone would produce a simple harmonic motion in x-direction given by, x a t = sin \u03c9 and the second would produce a simple harmonic motion in y-direction given by, y b t = + \u03c6 sin ( ) \u03c9 The amplitudes a and b may be different and their phases differ by \u03c6. The frequencies of the two simple harmonic motions are assumed to be equal. The resultant motion of the particle is a combination of the two simple harmonic motions. Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 317 l x x \u03b81 \u03b82 l, k l 2 , 2k l 2 , 2k \u21d2  Depending on the value of \u03c6 and relation between a and b, the particle follows different paths. These different paths are called Lissajous figures. Given below are few special cases : Case 1 (When \u03c6 = \u00b0 0 ) When the phase difference between two simple harmonic motions is 0\u00b0, i.e. x a t = sin \u03c9 \u21d2 sin \u03c9t x a = \u2026(i) y b t = sin \u03c9 \u21d2 sin \u03c9t y b = \u2026(ii) From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we get x a y b = or y b a x = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec\uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 which is equation of a straight line with slope b a\u22c5Thus, the path of the particle is a straight line. As a special case y x = if a b = or slope is 1. Case 2 when \u03c6 = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 \u03c0 2 When the phase difference is \u03c0 2 i.e. x a t = sin \u03c9 \u21d2 sin \u03c9t x a = \u2026(iii) y b t b t = + \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7= sin cos \u03c9 \u03c0 \u03c9 2 \u21d2 cos \u03c9t y b = \u2026(iv) Squaring and adding, Eqs. (iii) and (iv), we get x a y b 2 2 2 2 1 + = which is an ellipse. Again as a special case, the above equation reduces to, x a y a 2 2 2 2 1 + = or x y a 2 2 2 + = (fora b = ) This is an equation of a circle. 5. Free and damped oscillations We know that in reality, a spring won\u2019t oscillate forever with constant amplitude. These constant amplitude oscillations (which will really occur in vacuum) are called \u201cfree oscillations\u201d. Frictional forces will diminish the amplitude of oscillation until eventually the system comes to rest. We will now add frictional forces to the mass and spring. Imagine that the mass was put in a viscous liquid. To incorporate friction, we can just say that there is a frictional force that\u2019s proportional to the velocity of the mass. This is a pretty good approximation for a body moving at a low velocity in air, or in a liquid. So we say the frictional force f bv r = \u2212 . The constant b depends on the kind of liquid and the shape of the mass. The negative sign, just says that the force is in the opposite direction to the body\u2019s motion. Let\u2019s add this frictional force in to the equation F ma net = \u2212 \u2212 = kx bv ma ...(i) In terms of derivatives, m d x dt b dx dt kx 2 2 0 + + = ...(ii) 318 \u0097 Mechanics - II  This is a differential equation. In the solution of this type of differential equation instead of the amplitude being constant, it is decaying with time. A t A e t ( ) = \u2212 0 \u03b1 Here, \u03b1 is a positive constant. So, x t A t t A e t t ( ) ( ) cos ( ) cos ( ) = + = + \u2212 \u03c9 \u03b4 \u03c9 \u03b4 \u03b1 0 Here\u2019s a plot of an example of such a function. These types of oscillations which eventually come to end are called \u201cdamped oscillations\u201d. There are further three types of damped oscillations, namely (i) Under damped (ii) Critically damped and (iii) Over damped oscillations But their detailed discussion is out of our syllabus at this stage. Natural Frequency (or Characteristic Frequency) That is the frequency at which a system would oscillate by itself if displaced. The natural frequency of a spring-mass system is f k m 0 1 2 = \u03c0 , where k is the spring constant and m is the mass of the object attached to the spring. Forced Oscillations A periodic force at a given frequency (called driving frequency fd) is applied to an oscillating system of natural frequency f0. At the beginning (transient stage), there is a mixture of two kinds of oscillations, one has the frequencyf0 and the other hasfd. The former will gradually die out because of the damping effect. Eventually (at the steady state) the system settles down with oscillation at the frequency of the driving force ( ) fd . Resonance When the driving frequency is at the same frequency as the natural frequency of the oscillator, the amplitude of oscillation is at its greatest. When this happens the energy of the oscillator becomes a maximum. This is called a condition of resonance. Resonance and its Consequences The fact that there is an amplitude peak at driving frequencies close to the natural frequency of the system is called resonance. Physics is full of examples of resonance ; building up the oscillations of a child on a swing by pushing with a frequency equal to the swing's natural frequency is one. Inexpensive loudspeakers often have an unwanted boom or buzz when a musical note happens to coincide with the resonant frequency of the speaker cone. Resonance also occurs in electric circuits ; a tuned circuit in a radio or television receiver responds strongly to waves having frequencies near its resonant frequency, and this fact is used to select a particular station and reject the others. Resonance in mechanical systems can be destructive. A company of soldiers once destroyed a bridge by marching across it in step ; the frequency of their steps was close to the natural vibration frequency of the bridge and the resulting oscillation had large enough amplitude to tear the bridge apart. Ever since, marching soldiers have been ordered to break step before crossing a bridge. Nearly everyone has seen the film of the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows suspension bridge in 1940.

Concept The method discussed here is a general method which can be applied for any type of motion. How to Solve? Differentiate the given x t- equation and find v t- equation. Now, put t = 0 in both x t- and v t- equations. V Example 1 x t - equation of a particle executing SHM is x A t = \u2212 \u00b0 cos( ) \u03c9 45 Find the point from where particle starts its journey and the direction of its initial velocity. Solution Given, x A t = \u2212 \u00b0 cos( ) \u03c9 45 \u2026(i) v dx dt A t = = \u2212 \u2212 \u00b0 \u03c9 \u03c9 sin( ) 45 \u2026(ii) Putting t =0 in both equations we have, x A = + 2 and v A = + \u03c9 2 So, the particle starts from x A = + 2 with velocity in positive direction. Note By further differentiating v t - equation, we can make a t - equation and by putting t = 0, we can also find initial value of acceleration. Type 2. First Use of reference circle (to make x t - equation corresponding to given initial conditions). How to Solve? For the given SHM particle P on the diameter we have to find its circular motion particle Q on the circle according to given initial conditions. The following points will help you in finding the particle Q. \u2013A +A O v = + \u03c9A \u221a2 A \u221a2 + At = 0 t Solved Examples  \u2022 Particle Q can rotate, either clockwise or anticlockwise. But in all problems, we will take it anticlockwise. \u2022 We can draw the perpendicular on any diameter but in all problems we will draw the perpendicular lying along x-axis. \u2022 If initial velocity of SHM particle P is negative then Q lies in upper half of the reference circle. Because, whenQ moves in upper half of the circle (anticlockwise) P moves from + A to \u2212A along negative x-direction. Similarly, if P has  an initial  velocity in positive direction then Q is in lower half of the circle. \u2022 If initial value of x is positive then Q lies to the right of O (between 0 and + A) and if x is negative, then Q lies to the left of O (between 0 and \u2212A ). \u2022 If initial value of x is suppose + 3 2 A and velocity is negative then circular particle Q is in the position as shown in figure. This particle is 120\u00b0 ahead (in anticlockwise direction) or 240\u00b0 behind (in clockwise direction) from sine line or it is 30\u00b0 ahead or 330\u00b0 behind the cosine line. Hence, the x t- equation corresponding to given initial conditions may be x A t = + \u00b0 sin( ) \u03c9 120 = \u2212 \u00b0 A t sin( ) \u03c9 240 = + \u00b0 A t cos( ) \u03c9 30 = \u2212 \u00b0 A t cos( ) \u03c9 330 V Example 2 A particle in SHM starts its journey (at t=0) from x A = \u22122 in negative direction. Write x t - equation corresponding to given conditions. Angular frequency of oscillations is \u03c9. Solution For the given initial conditions, particle Q on reference circle is as shown in figure. This is 210\u00b0 ahead or 150\u00b0 behind the sine line or 120\u00b0 ahead or 240\u00b0 behind the cosine line. Therefore, the x t - equation can be written as x A t = + \u00b0 sin( ) \u03c9 210 = \u2212 \u00b0 A t sin( ) \u03c9 150 = + \u00b0 A t cos( ) \u03c9 120 = \u2212 \u00b0 A t cos( ) \u03c9 240 Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 321 \u2013A y O x cosine line +A \u2013 2 A P A Q sine line 60\u00b0 +A \u2013A y A Q O 30\u00b0 P x \u221a3 A + 2 cosine line sine line  Type 3. Second use of reference circle (to find the shortest time in moving the particle from one point to another point between + A and \u2212A ). Concept Linear speed of particle in SHM is not constant (more near mean positive and less near mean extreme positions) So, we cannot apply time distance speed = but the angular speed of its corresponding particle on reference circle is constant. Therefore, t = \u03b8 \u03c9 (\u03b8 in radian) can be applied for that particle. The following table will help you in solving such problems.

Solution As shown in figure, as the SHM particle P moves from P1 to P2, its corresponding particle Q on reference circle rotates from Q1 to Q2 an angle of 90\u00b0. From the above table, we can see that, in rotating an angle of 90\u00b0 the time taken is T 4 . t T = 4 Ans. 322 \u0097 Mechanics - II \u221a3A 2 \u2013 30\u00b0 ",

Third Use of reference circle (finding time of collision of two particles executing SHM along same straight line with same \u03c9 and A but different initial conditions). How to Solve? Corresponding to initial conditions of SHM particles P1 and P2, first find their particles Q1 and Q2 on the reference circle. Now, we can see that the particles Q1 and Q2 will never collide as they are rotating in the same direction (anticlockwise) with same \u03c9 and T. But the perpendiculars from Q1 and Q2 on our diameter along x-axis will collide when this diameter becomes the bisector line of the constant angle \u03b2 (between OQ1 and OQ2) as shown below.

Concept In most of the x t - equations of SHM, x is measured from the mean position. In this type of problems, we have to write S t - equation. But S here is not measured from the mean position. The method can be best explained by the following example: V Example 17 A block in SHM starts from + A position. Write S t - equation of the block, if S is measured from \u2212A. Solution When the block starts from + A and x at any time \u2018t\u2019 is measured from the mean position, then x A t = cos\u03c9 In the figure, we can see that S A x = + or S A A t = + cos\u03c9 or S A t = + ( cos ) 1 \u03c9 Ans.

Based on the concept of pseudo force. Concept If a block is observed from an accelerating or non-inertial frame of reference, a pseudo force ( ) = \u2212ma has to be applied on the block. Here, \u2018m\u2019 is the mass of the block and a the acceleration of frame of reference. V Example 18 A spring block system is kept inside the smooth surface of a trolley as shown in figure. At t = 0, trolley is given an acceleration \u2018a\u2019 in the direction shown in figure. Write S t - equation of the block (a) with respect to trolley. (b) with respect to ground. Note S has to be measured from the starting point (at t =0) not from the mean position of SHM with respect to trolley. Solution (a) Trolley is an accelerating or non-inertial frame. So, a pseudo force F ma = has to be applied on the block towards left. Here, P or natural length of the spring is not the mean position (of SHM of the block with respect to trolley). Let mean position (where Fnet =0) is obtained after an extension of x0. Then ma kx = 0 \u21d2x ma k 0 = This x0 is also the amplitude of SHM of block with respect to trolley. \u2234 A x ma k = = 0 Further, at t =0, block is at x A = + . Therefore, x t - equation of block is, x A t = cos\u03c9 (where, \u03c9 = k m) But in this equation x is measured from the mean position and we have to measure S from the starting point ( ) = + A 332 \u0097 Mechanics - II m K a Kx0 x0 x = 0 x A = + t = 0 F ma = F ma = Q P \u2013A + = 0 A t O t t = +ve x Sbt  From the figure we can see that, Sbt = displacement of block with respect to trolley. = \u2212 \u2212 ( ) A x = \u2212 \u2212 ( cos ) A A t \u03c9 S A t A bt = \u2212 ( cos ) \u03c9 Ans.

Type 10. Distance travelled in a given time interval. Concept Linear speed of particle in SHM is not constant. Therefore, we cannot apply, distance = speed time \u00d7 How to Solve? From the given x t- equation, find the starting point, amplitude and time period of oscillations. V Example 19 x t - equation of a particle in SHM is x cm t = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 ( )cos 4 2 \u03c0 Here, t is in seconds. Find the distance travelled by the particle in first three seconds.

The given time t =3 sec is 3 4 T. So, the particle moves from + A to \u2212A and then from \u2212A to O. So, distance travelled in the given time interval is 3A or 12 cm. Ans. Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 333 \u2013A +A O T/2 T/4  Type 11. Graph Based problems. V Example 20 For a particle executing SHM, the displacement x is given by x A t = cos . \u03c9 Identify the graph which represents the variation of potential energy (PE) as a function of time t and displacement x. (JEE 2003) (a) I, III (b) II, IV (c) II, III (d) I, IV Solution Potential energy is minimum (in this case zero) at mean position ( ) x = 0 and maximum at extreme positions ( ) x A = + . At time t x A = = 0, . Hence, PE should be maximum. Therefore, graph I is correct. Further in graph III, PE is minimum at x = 0. Hence, this is also correct. V Example 21 x t - graph of a particle in SHM is At time t t = 0, what are the signs of v and a of the particle? Solution v dx dt = = slope of x t - graph. At time t t = 0, slope is positive. So, velocity is positive. a x \u221d\u2212 At time t t = 0, x is positive. Hence, acceleration is negative because \u2018a\u2019 and \u2018x\u2019 are always of opposite signs. Note At time t0, velocity is positive and acceleration is negative. So, speed of the particle at this instant is decreasing or the particle is moving towards the extreme position. Type 12.

Change in variable force method for finding time period of SHM. Concept (i) Two types of forces may act on a body: constant and variable. Weight of a body (for small heights) and the upthrust force on a solid when it is completely immersed in a liquid are constant forces. Spring force, upthrust force when the body is partially immersed in a liquid, tension and normal reaction are variable forces. Tension and normal reaction seem to be constant forces but actually they are variable forces. In the figure shown, N mg = if a = 0 N m g a = + ( ) if a is upwards and N m g a = \u2212 ( ) if a is downwards. So, normal reaction N is not a constant force. (ii) In equilibrium, summation of all constant and variable forces is zero. (iii) When displaced from the mean position, constant forces do not contribute in the net restoring force (therefore in time period). They can only change the mean position. So, just forget the constant forces. Only change in variable force becomes the net restoring force. \u2234 Fnet = \u2212 = \u2206F net restoring force. where, F is the variable force. (iv) If two or more than two variable forces are acting on a body and both either increase or decrease (when displaced from the mean position), then F F F net = \u2212 + [ ] \u2206 \u2206 1 2 If one variable force increases and the other decreases then, F F F net = \u2212[ ~ ] \u2206 \u2206 1 2 Let us understand this concept with an example. In the above figures, F1 is a constant force and F2 is a variable force. In equilibrium, F F 1 2 10 = = N(say) or Fnet = 0 When displaced from the mean position, F1 being a constant force remains 10 N. But, suppose F2 becomes F\u2032 = 2 8 N . Then, net force is 2 1 2 N( ) = \u2212 \u2032 F F in upward direction or towards the mean position. We can see that this net force is also equal to change (here decrease) in variable force F2. 336 \u0097 Mechanics - II N mg a ",

This net restoring force should be of type F kx = \u2212 \u21d2Now, T m k = 2\u03c0 V Example 23 A plank of mass \u2018m\u2019 and area of cross-section A is floating in a non-viscous liquid of density \u03c1. When displaced slightly from the mean position, it starts oscillating. Prove that oscillations are simple harmonic and find its time period. Solution Two forces are acting on the plank: weight and upthrust. Weight is a constant force. So, forget it. Upthrust (if partially immersed) is a variable force. When displaced downwards by a distance x, then Net restoring force Fnet = \u2212[change or increase in variable force upthrust] = \u2212[( )( ) ( )] extra immersed volume density of liquid g = \u2212[( ) ( ) ( )] Ax g \u03c1 This force is of type F kx = \u2212 . So, motion is simple harmonic, where k Ag =\u03c1 \u2234 T m k =2\u03c0 or T m Ag =2\u03c0 \u03c1 Ans. Note (i) Upthrust force is given by F immersed volume of solid density of liquid g = ( ) ( )( ) = V g i \u03c1 \u21d2\u2234 \u2206 \u2206 F V g i =( ) \u03c1 [as \u03c1 and g are constant] (ii) In the above problem, upthrust is just like a spring force of force constant: k Ag =\u03c1 V Example 24 A plank of mass \u2018m\u2019 and area of cross-section A is floating as shown in figure. When slightly displaced from mean position, plank starts oscillations. Find time period of these oscillations. Chapter 14 Simple Harmonic Motion \u0097 337 m A , \u03c1 m A , \u03c1 K  Solution Three forces are acting on the plank : (i) weight (ii) spring force (iii) upthrust Weight is a constant force. So, it will not contribute in the time period. Spring force and upthrust are variable forces. When displaced downwards from the mean position, both forces increase. So, their force constants are additive \u2234 k k Ag e = + \u03c1 \u2234 T m ke =2\u03c0 = + 2\u03c0 \u03c1 m k Ag Ans. Note If the plank oscillates with fully immersed position, then upthrust also becomes a constant force. So, the only varibale force remains kx. Therefore, T m k =2\u03c0 V Example 25 Figure shows a system consisting of a massless pulley, a spring of force constant k and a block of mass m. If the block is slightly displaced vertically down from its equilibrium position and released, find the period of its vertical oscillation in cases (a) and (b).

Tension is a variable force. Let tension increases by F when displaced from the equilibrium position by x. This increase in tension is the change in variable force. So, this is also the net restoring force. The distribution of this increase in tension F is as shown in figure. Spring gets an extra stretching force 2F. Let x0 is the extra extension in the spring by this extra force 2F. Then, 2 0 F kx = or x F k 0 2 = \u2026(i) Now, we can see that by this extra extension of spring, pulley will also come down by the same distance x0 and x x F k = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 2 2 2 0 \u21d2 F k x = 4 But F is also the net restoring force on block.

Suppose, two masses m1 and m2 are connected by a horizontal massless spring of force constant k, so as to be free to oscillate along the length of the spring on a frictionless horizontal surface. Let l0 be the natural length of the spring and let x1 and x2 be the coordinates of the two masses at any instant of time. Then, Extension of the spring x x x l = \u2212 \u2212 ( ) 1 2 0 \u2026(i) For x > 0, the spring force F kx = acts on the two masses in the directions shown in above figure. Thus, we can write m d x dt kx 1 2 1 2 = \u2212 \u2026(ii) m d x dt kx 2 2 2 2 = \u2026(iii) Multiplying Eq. (ii) by m2 and Eq.

At a certain instant they are found at distance A 3 from the origin on opposite sides but their velocities are found to be in the same direction. What is the phase difference between the two ?

Whenever a load is attached to a thin hanging wire it elongates and the load moves downwards (sometimes through a negligible distance). The amount by which the wire elongates depends upon the amount of load and the nature of wire material. Cohesive force, between the molecules of the hanging wire offer resistance against the deformation, and the force of resistance increases with the deformation. The process of deformation stops when the force of resistance is equal to the external force (i.e. the load attached). Sometimes the force of resistance offered by the molecules is less than the external force. In such a case, the deformation continues until the wire breaks. Thus, we may conclude that if some external deforming force is applied to a body it has two effects on it, namely : (i) deformation of the body, (ii) internal resistance (restoring) forces are developed. 15.2 Elasticity As we have already discussed that whenever a single force (or a system of forces) acts on a body it undergoes some deformation and the molecules offer some resistance to the deformation. When the external force is removed, the force of resistance also vanishes and the body returns back to its original shape. But it is only possible if the deformation is within a certain limit. Such a limit is called elastic limit. This property of materials of returning back to their original position is called the elasticity. A body is said to be perfectly elastic if it returns back completely to its original shape and size after removing the external force. If a body remains in the deformed state and does not even partially regain its original shape after the removal of the deforming forces, it is called a perfectly inelastic or plastic body. Quite often, when the external forces are removed, the body partially regains the original shape. Such bodies are partially elastic. If the force acting on the body is increased and the deformation exceeds the elastic limit, the body loses to some extent, its property of elasticity. In this case, the body will not return to its original shape and size even after removal of the external force. Some deformation is left permanently. 15.3 Stress and Strain Stress When an external force is applied to a body then at each cross-section of the body an internal restoring force is developed which tends to restore the body to its original state. The internal restoring force per unit area of cross-section of the deformed body is called stress. It is usually denoted by \u03c3 (sigma). Thus, Stress Restoring force Area ( ) \u03c3 = Note In equilibrium, when further deformation stops, the restoring force is equal to the external force (or the suspended load from a hanging wire). Therefore, the stress is also sometime called the external deforming force per unit area. 374 \u0097 Mechanics - II  Strain When the size or shape of a body is changed under an external force, the body is said to be strained. The change occurred in the unit size of the body is called strain. Usually, it is denoted by \u03b5. Thus, \u03b5 = \u2206x x Here, \u2206x is the change (may be in length, volume etc.) and x the original value of the quantity in which change has occurred. For example, when the length of a suspended wire increases under an applied load, the value of strain is, \u03b5 = \u2206l l 15.4 Hooke's Law and the Modulus of Elasticity According to Hooke\u2019s law, \u201cFor small deformation, the stress in a body is proportional to the corresponding strain.\u201d i.e. stress strain \u221d or stress = ( ) (strain) E Here, E = stress strain is a constant called the modulus of elasticity. Now, depending upon the nature of deforming force applied on the body, stress, strain and hence modulus of elasticity are classified in following three types: Young\u2019s Modulus of Elasticity (Y ) When a wire is acted upon by two equal and opposite forces in the direction of its length, the length of the body is changed. The change in length per unit length \u2206l l \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7is called the longitudinal strain and the restoring force (which is equal to the applied force in equilibrium) per unit area of cross section of the wire is called the longitudinal stress. For small change in the length of the wire, the ratio of the longitudinal stress to the corresponding strain is called the Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity ( ) Y of the wire. Thus, Y ",

Find the dimensions of stress, strain and modulus of elasticity. 15.5 The Stress-Strain Curve A plot of longitudinal stress (either tensile or compressive) versus longitudingal strain for a typical solid is shown in figure. The strain is directly proportional to the applied stress for values of stress upto \u03c3P . In this linear region, the material returns to its original size when the stress is removed. Point P is known as the proportional limit of the solid. For stresses between \u03c3P and \u03c3E , where point E is called the elastic limit, the material also returns to its original size. However, notice that stress and strain are not proportional in this region. For deformations beyond the elastic limit, the material does not return to its original size when the stress is removed, it is permanently distorted. Finally, further stretching beyond the elastic limit leads to the eventual fracture of the solid. The proportionality constant for linear region or the slope of stress-strain curve in this curve is called the Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity Y. 378 \u0097 Mechanics - II INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 15.1 P (Proportional limit) E (Elastic limit) (Fracture point) E \u03c3 P \u03c3 The stress-strain curve for a typical solid \u03c3 \u03b5 O Fig. 15.5  15.6 Potential Energy Stored in a Stretched Wire When a wire is stretched, work is done against the inter atomic forces.

If the body is allowed to expand or contract freely, with the rise or fall of the temperature, no stresses are induced in the body. But if the deformation of the body is prevented, some stresses are induced in the body. Such stresses are called thermal stresses or temperature stresses. The corresponding strains are called thermal strains or temperature strains. Consider a rod AB fixed at two supports as shown in figure. Let l = length of rod A = area of cross-section of the rod Y = Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity of the rod and \u03b1 = thermal coefficient of linear expansion of the rod Let the temperature of the rod is increased by an amount t. The length of the rod would had increased by an amount \u2206l, if it were not fixed at two supports. Here \u2206l l t = \u03b1 Chapter 15 Elasticity \u0097 379 A B Fig. 15.6  But the rod is fixed at the supports. Hence a compressive strain will be produced in the rod. Because at the increased temperature, the natural length of the rod is l l + \u2206, while being fixed at two supports its actual length is l. Hence, thermal strain \u03b5 = + \u2206\u2248\u2206= = \u2206l l l l l l t l t \u03b1 \u03b1 or \u03b5 = \u03b1t Therefore, thermal stress \u03c3 = \u03b5 Y ( ) stress = strain Y \u00d7 or \u03c3 \u03b1 = Y t or force on the supports, F A YA t = = \u03c3 \u03b1 This force F is in the direction shown below.

(ii) E \u221d 1 strain (for same stress), i.e. if the same amount of stress is applied on two different materials, the one having the less strain is having more E. Rather we can say that the material which offers more resistance to the external forces is having greater value of E. So, we can see that modulus of elasticity of steel is more than that of rubber or E E steel rubber > (iii) E = stress for unit strain \u2206 \u2206 x x x x = = \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7 1 or , i.e. suppose the length of a wire is 2 m, then the Young\u2019s modulus of elasticity( ) Y is the stress applied on the wire to stretch the wire by the same length of 2 m. \u0098 The material which has smaller value of Y is more ductile, i.e. it offers less resistance in framing it into a wire. Similarly, the material having the smaller value of B is more malleable. Thus, for making wire we will more concentrate on Y. Chapter 15 Elasticity \u0097 381 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 15.2  \u0098 A solid will have all the three modulii of elasticity Y, B and \u03b7.

Physically this can be explained as under: Suppose we have two containers A and B. Some gas is filled in both the containers. But the pressure in A is more than the pressure in B, i.e. p p 1 2 > So, bulk modulus of A should be more than the bulk modulus of B, or B B 1 2 > and this is quiet obvious, because it is more difficult to compress the gas in chamber A, i.e. it provides more resistance to the external forces.

If rod is not fixed from its two ends and it is free to expand or contract then no stresses will be developed in it. If rod is fixed from its two ends then it means rod is not allowed to expand or contract. So stresses are developed. If temperature is decreased, then its natural length is less but it is fixed from two ends. So, we can assume that it has been stretched by \u2206l from its natural length l l \u2212\u2206( ) \u2248l . So, tensile stresses will be developed.

A fluid is a substance that deforms continuously under the application of a shear (tangential) stress no matter how small the shear stress may be. Thus, fluids comprise the liquid and gas (or vapour) phases of the physical forms in which matter exists. The distinction between a fluid and the solid state of matter is clear if you compare fluid and solid behaviour. A solid deforms when a shear stress is applied but it does not continue to increase with time. However, if a shear stress is applied to a fluid, the deformation continues to increase as long as the stress is applied. We may alternatively define a fluid as a substance that cannot sustain a shear stress when at rest. Ideal Fluid An ideal liquid is incompressible and non-viscous in nature. An incompressible liquid means the density of the liquid is constant, it is independent of the variations in pressure. A non-viscous liquid means that, parts of the liquid in contact do not exert any tangential force on each other. Thus, there is no friction between the adjacent layers of a liquid. The force by one part of the liquid on the other part is perpendicular to the surface of contact. 16.2 Density of a Liquid Density ( ) \u03c1 of any substance is defined as the mass per unit volume or \u03c1 = mass volume or \u03c1 = m V Relative Density (RD) In case of a liquid, sometimes an another term Relative Density (RD) is defined. It is the ratio of density of the substance to the density of water at 4\u00b0C. Hence, RD = Density of substance Density of water at 4 C \u00b0 RD is a pure ratio. So, it has no units. It is also sometimes referred as specific gravity. Density of water at 4\u00b0C in CGS is 1 g/cm 3. Therefore, numerically the RD and density of substance (in CGS) are equal. In SI units, the density of water at 4\u00b0C is 1000 kg/m 3. 404 \u0097 Mechanics - II F (a) Solid F (b) Fluid Fig. 16.1 Behaviour of a solid and a fluid, under the action of a constant shear force  Density of a Mixture of two or more Liquids Here, we have two cases: Case 1 Suppose two liquids of densities \u03c11 and \u03c12 having masses m1 and m2 are mixed together.

If we think of an imaginary surface within the fluid, the fluid on the two sides of the surface exerts equal and opposite forces on the surface, otherwise the surface would accelerate and the fluid would not remain at rest. 406 \u0097 Mechanics - II dF\u22a5 dF\u22a5 dA Fig. 16.2  Consider a small surface of area dA centered on a point on the fluid, the normal force exerted by the fluid on each side is dF\u22a5.The pressure p is defined at that point as the normal force per unit area, i.e. p dF dA = \u22a5 If the pressure is the same at all points of a finite plane surface with area A, then p F A = \u22a5 where, F\u22a5is the normal force on one side of the surface. The SI unit of pressure is pascal, where 1pascal = 1Pa = 1.0 N/m 2 One unit used principally in meterology is the Bar which is equal to 105 Pa. 1Bar = 10 Pa 5 Atmospheric Pressure (p0) It is pressure of the earth\u2019s atmosphere. This changes with weather and elevation. Normal atmospheric pressure at sea level (an average value) is 1.013 10 Pa 5 \u00d7 . Thus, 1atm = 1.013 10 Pa 5 \u00d7 Note Fluid pressure acts perpendicular to any surface in the fluid no matter how that surface is oriented. Hence, pressure has no intrinsic direction of its own, it is a scalar. By contrast, force is a vector with a definite direction. Absolute Pressure and Gauge Pressure The excess pressure above atmospheric pressure is usually called gauge pressure and the total pressure is called absolute pressure. Thus, Gauge pressure absolute pressure \u2013 atmospheric pressure = Absolute pressure is always greater than or equal to zero. While gauge pressure can be negative also. Variation in Pressure with Depth If the weight of the fluid can be neglected, the pressure in a fluid is the same throughout its volume. But often the fluid\u2019s weight is not negligible and under such condition pressure increases with increasing depth below the surface. Let us now derive a general relation between the pressure p at any point in a fluid at rest and the elevation y of that point. We will assume that the density \u03c1 and the acceleration due to gravity g are the same throughout the fluid. If the fluid is in equilibrium, every volume element is in equilibrium. Consider a thin element of fluid with height dy. The bottom and top surfaces each have area A, and they are at elevations y and y dy + above some reference level where y = 0. The weight of the fluid element is dw g A dy g = = (volume) (density) ( ) ( )( )( ) \u03c1 or dw gAdy = \u03c1 Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 407 dy y dy dw pA ( + ) p dp A Fig. 16.3  What are the other forces in y-direction on this fluid element? Call the pressure at the bottom surface p, the total y-component of upward force is pA. The pressure at the top surface is p dp + and the total y-component of downward force on the top surface is ( ) . p dp A + The fluid element is in equilibrium, so the total y-component of force including the weight and the forces at the bottom and top surfaces must be zero. \u03a3Fy = 0 \u2234 pA p dp A gA dy \u2212 + \u2212 = ( ) \u03c1 0 or dp dy g = \u2212\u03c1 \u2026(i) This equation shows that when y increases, p decreases, i.e. as we move upward in the fluid, pressure decreases. If p1 and p2 be the pressures at elevations y1 and y2 and if \u03c1 and g are constant, then integrating Eq. (i), we get dp g dy p p y y 1 2 1 2 \u222b \u222b = \u2212\u03c1 or p p g y y 2 1 2 1 \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212 \u03c1 ( ) \u2026(ii) It is often convenient to express Eq. (ii) in terms of the depth below the surface of a fluid. Take point 1 at depth h below the surface of fluid and let p represents pressure at this point. Take point 2 at the surface of the fluid, where the pressure is p0 (subscript zero for zero depth). The depth of point 1 below the surface is, h y y = \u2212 2 1 and Eq. (ii) becomes p p g y y gh 0 2 1 \u2212 = \u2212 \u2212 = \u2212 \u03c1 \u03c1 ( ) \u2234 p p gh = + 0 \u03c1 \u2026(iii) Thus, pressure increases linearly with depth, if\u03c1and g are uniform. A graph between p and h is shown below. Further, the pressure is the same at any two points at the same level in the fluid. The shape of the container does not matter. 408 \u0097 Mechanics - II y1 y2 p1 p2 Fig. 16.4 p0 p h p p gh = 0 + \u03c1 A B p0 p0 h p = gh A B 0 p p = + \u03c1 Fig. 16.5 Fig. 16.6  Pascal\u2019s Law Pascal\u2019s law or the principle of transmission of fluid-pressure is a principle in fluid mechanics that states that pressure exerted anywhere in a confined incompressible fluid is transmitted equally in all directions throughout the fluid. The simplest instance of this is stepping on a balloon; the balloon bulges out on all sides under the foot and not just on one side. This is precisely what Pascal\u2019s law is all about \u2013 the air which is the fluid in this case, was confined by the balloon and you applied pressure with your foot causing it to get displaced uniformly. A well known application of Pascal\u2019s law is the hydraulic lift used to support or lift heavy objects. It is schematically illustrated in figure. A piston with small cross section area A1 exerts a force F1 on the surface of a liquid such as oil. The applied pressure p F A = 1 1 is transmitted through the connecting pipe to a larger piston of area A2.The applied pressure is the same in both cylinders, so p F A F A = = 1 1 2 2 or F A A F 2 2 1 1 = . Now, since A A 2 1 > , therefore, F F 2 1 > . Thus, hydraulic lift is a force multiplying device with a multiplication factor equal to the ratio of the areas of the two pistons. Dentist\u2019s chairs, car lifts and jacks, many elevators and hydraulic brakes all use this principle. \u0098 At same point on a fluid pressure is same in all directions. In the figure, p p p p 1 2 3 4 = = = \u0098 Forces acting on a fluid in equilibrium have to be perpendicular to its surface. Because it cannot sustain the shear stress.

It changes only in vertical direction. At a height difference \u2018h\u2019, difference in pressure (or change in pressure) is \u2206p gh = \u00b1\u03c1 Pressure increases with depth. So, \u2206p gh = +\u03c1 in moving downwards and \u2206p gh = \u2212\u03c1 in moving upwards. If fluids are accelerated then pressure changes in both horizontal and vertical directions. In Horizontal Direction (i) Pressure decreases in the direction of acceleration. (ii) At a horizontal distance x change in pressure is \u2206p ax = \u00b1\u03c1 (a = horizontal acceleration) Take \u2206p ax = +\u03c1 , while moving in opposite direction of acceleration. Because pressure increases in the opposite direction of acceleration and take \u2206P ax = \u2212\u03c1 while moving in the direction of acceleration. In Vertical Direction Instead of \u2018g\u2019 in the equation, \u2206p gh = \u00b1\u03c1 take effective value of g or ge. Thus, \u2206p g h e = \u00b1\u03c1 Here, g g e = if vertical acceleration of fluid is zero. g g a e = + if vertical acceleration of fluid \u2018a\u2019 is upwards and g g a e = \u2212 if vertical acceleration \u2018a\u2019 is downwards. In equation form, all above statements can be explained as below. Consider a liquid kept at rest in a beaker as shown in Fig. 16.24 (a). In this case, we know that pressure do not change in horizontal direction (x-direction), it decreases upwards along y-direction. So, we can write the equations, dp dx = 0 and dp dy g = \u2212\u03c1 \u2026(i) 414 \u0097 Mechanics - II x y o x y o ay ax (a) (b) Fig. 16.24  But, suppose the beaker is accelerated and it has components of acceleration ax and a y in x and y directions respectively, then the pressure decreases along both x and y-directions. The above equations in that case become, dp dx ax = \u2212\u03c1 and dp dy g a y = \u2212 + \u03c1( ) \u2026(ii) These equations can be derived as under : Consider a beaker filled with some liquid of density \u03c1 accelerating upwards with an acceleration a y along positive y-direction. Let us draw the free body diagram of a small element of fluid of area A and length dy as shown in figure. Equation of motion for this fluid element is, pA W p dp A a y \u2212 \u2212 + = ( ) ( )( ) mass or \u2212 \u2212 = W dp A A dy a y ( ) ( )( ) \u03c1 or \u2212 \u2212 = ( ) ( ) ( )( ) A g dy dp A A dy a y \u03c1 \u03c1 or dp dy g a y = \u2212 + \u03c1( ) Similarly, if the beaker moves along positive x-direction with an acceleration ax, the equation of motion for the fluid element shown in figure is, pA p dp A ax \u2212 + = ( ) ( )( ) mass or \u2212 = ( ) ( ) dp A A dx ax \u03c1 or dp dx ax = \u2212\u03c1 Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 415 x y A p dy p + dp A pA ay (p + ) dp A ay Fig. 16.25 x y o A p + dp p dx ax A (p + ) dp A pA ax Fig. 16.26  Note (i) dp dx ax = \u2212\u03c1 , \u2206p a x x = \u2212 = \u03c1 pressure difference in a horizontal distance x. Here, negative sign implies that pressure decreases with x or in the direction of acceleration. (ii) In Fig. 16.26, pressure on left hand side of the fluid element should be more than the pressure on right hand side of this element. This is because this element is accelerated only due to this pressure difference. (iii) dp dy g ay = \u2212 + \u03c1( ) \u21d2 \u2206p g a y y = \u2212 + \u03c1( ) or \u2206p g h e = \u2212\u03c1 Here, negative sign implies that pressure decreases with \u2018y\u2019 or in moving upwards. Free Surface of a Liquid Accelerated in Horizontal Direction Consider a liquid placed in a beaker which is accelerating horizontally with an acceleration \u2018a\u2019. Let A and B be two points in the liquid at a separation x in the same horizontal line. As we have seen in this case dp dx a = \u2212\u03c1 or dp a dx = \u2212\u03c1 Integrating this with proper limits, we get p p ax A B \u2212 = \u03c1 \u2026(iii) Further, p p gh A = + 0 1 \u03c1 and p p gh B = + 0 2 \u03c1 Substituting in Eq. (iii), we get \u03c1 \u03c1 g h h ax ( ) 1 2 \u2212 = \u2234 h h x a g 1 2 \u2212 = = tan \u03b8 \u2234 tan \u03b8 = a g Pressure Difference in Rotating Fluids In a rotating fluid (also accelerating) pressure increases in moving away from the rotational axis. At a distance \u2018x\u2019 from the rotational axis, pressure difference is \u2206p x = \u00b1 \u03c1\u03c92 2 2 Take \u2206p x = + \u03c1\u03c92 2 2 in moving away from the rotational axis, as pressure increases in this direction and take \u2206p x = \u2212\u03c1\u03c92 2 2 in moving towards the rotational axis. 416 \u0097 Mechanics - II y B x a \u03b8 h1 h2 A x Fig. 16.27  Proof Suppose that liquid of density\u03c1kept inside a tube of area of cross-section Ais rotating with an angular velocity \u2018\u03c9\u2019 as shown.

Mass of this element is, dm= ( ) ( ) density volume or dm Adx = ( ) \u03c1 This element is rotating in a circle of radius \u2018x\u2019. So, this is accelerated towards centre with a centripetal acceleration a x = \u03c92 (as a R = \u03c92) To provide this acceleration, pressure on right hand side of the element should be more. \u2234 ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) ( ) p dp A p A dm a Adx x + \u2212 = = \u03c1 \u03c92 or dp x dx = ( ) \u03c1 \u03c92 \u2234 \u2206p xdx x = \u222b ( ) \u03c1\u03c92 0 or \u2206p x = \u03c1\u03c92 2 2 Hence proved.

This is because the water exerts an upward force called buoyant force. It is equal to the weight of the fluid displaced by the body. A body wholly or partially submerged in a fluid is buoyed up by a force equal to the weight of the displaced fluid. This result is known as Archimedes\u2019 principle. Thus, the magnitude of buoyant force ( ) F is given by, F V g i L = \u03c1 Here, Vi = immersed volume of solid, \u03c1L = density of liquid and g = acceleration due togravity 420 \u0097 Mechanics - II A N M C a Fig. 16.33 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 16.2 A \u03c9 B 2 m Fig. 16.34  Proof Consider an arbitrarily shaped body of volume V placed in a container filled with a fluid of density\u03c1L . The body is shown completely immersed, but complete immersion is not essential to the proof. To begin with, imagine the situation before the body was immersed. The region now occupied by the body was filled with fluid, whose weight wasV g L \u03c1 .Because the fluid as a whole was in hydrostatic equilibrium, the net upwards force (due to difference in pressure at different depths) on the fluid in that region was equal to the weight of the fluid occupying that region. Now, consider what happens when the body has displaced the fluid. The pressure at every point on the surface of the body is unchanged from the value at the same location when the body was not present. This is because the pressure at any point depends only on the depth of that point below the fluid surface. Hence, the net force exerted by the surrounding fluid on the body is exactly the same as that exerted on the region before the body was present. But we know the latter to beV g L \u03c1 , the weight of the displaced fluid. Hence, this must also be the buoyant force exerted on the body. Archimedes\u2019 principle is thus proved. Law of Floatation Consider an object of volume V and density \u03c1S floating in a liquid of density \u03c1L . LetVi be the volume of object immersed in the liquid. For equilibrium of object, Weight Upthrust = \u2234 V g V g S i L \u03c1 \u03c1 = \u2234 V V i S L = \u03c1 \u03c1 \u2026(i) This is the fraction of volume immersed in liquid. Percentage of volume immersed in liquid = \u00d7 V V i 100 = \u00d7 \u03c1 \u03c1 S L 100 Three possibilities may now arise: (i) If\u03c1 \u03c1 S L < , only fraction of body will be immersed in the liquid. This fraction will be given by the above equation. (ii) If\u03c1 \u03c1 S L = , the whole of the rigid body will be immersed in the liquid. Hence, the body remains floating in the liquid wherever it is left. (iii) If \u03c1 \u03c1 S L > , the body will sink. Buoyant Force in Accelerating Fluids Suppose a body is dipped inside a liquid of density \u03c1L placed in an elevator moving with an acceleration a. The buoyant force F in this case becomes, F V g L = \u03c1 eff (V = immersed volume of solid orVi ) Here, geff = \u2212 | | g a Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 421 V \u03c1L Fig. 16.35 Vi \u03c1L Fig. 16.36  Extra Points to Remember For example, if the lift has an upward acceleration a, the value of geff is g a + and if it has a downward acceleration a, the geff is g a \u2212. In a freely falling lift geff is zero (as a g = ) and hence, net buoyant force is zero. This is why, in a freely falling vessel filled with some liquid, the air bubbles do not rise up (which otherwise move up due to buoyant force). The above result can be derived as follows. Suppose a body is dipped inside a liquid of density \u03c1L in an elevator moving up with an acceleration a. As was done earlier also, replace the body into the liquid by the same liquid of equal volume. The replaced liquid is at rest with respect to the elevator. Thus, this replaced liquid is also moving up with an acceleration a together with the rest of the liquid. The forces acting on the replaced liquid are, (i) the buoyant force F and (ii) the weight mg of the substituted liquid. From Newton\u2019s second law, F mg ma \u2212 = or F m g a = + ( ) Here, m V L = \u03c1 \u2234 F V g a V g L L = + = \u03c1 \u03c1 ( ) eff where g g a eff = + \u0098 In weight of a solid, take total volume of solid, density of solid and g. In upthrust (or buoyant force) take immersed volume of solid, density of liquid and geff . Thus, W V g s = \u03c1 F V g i L = \u03c1 eff \u0098 Upthrust force also makes a pair of equal and opposite forces. On solid it is upwards and on liquid, it is downwards. V Example 16.9 Density of ice is 900 kg/m3. A piece of ice is floating in water of density 1000 3 kg m / . Find the fraction of volume of the piece of ice outside the water. Solution Let V be the total volume and Vi the volume of ice piece immersed in water. For equilibrium of ice piece, weight upthrust = \u2234 V g V g i i w \u03c1 \u03c1 = Here, \u03c1i = density of ice = 900 kg/m3 and \u03c1w = density of water =1000 kg/m3 Substituting in above equation, we get V V i = = 900 1000 0.9 i.e. the fraction of volume outside the water, f = \u2212 = 1 0.9 0.1 Ans. 422 \u0097 Mechanics - II  V Example 16.10 A metallic sphere floats in an immiscible mixture of water ( / ) \u03c1w kg m =103 3 and a liquid ( / ) \u03c1L kg m = \u00d7 13.5 103 3 such that its 4 5 th volume is in water and 1 5 th volume in the liquid.

Ignore viscosity. 16.6 Flow of Fluids Steady Flow If the velocity of fluid particles at any point does not vary with time, the flow is said to be steady. Steady flow is also called streamlined or laminar flow. The velocity at different points may be different. Hence, in the figure, v1 = constant, v 2 = constant, v 3 = constant but v v v 1 2 3 \u2260 \u2260 Principle of Continuity It states that, when an incompressible and non-viscous liquid flows in a stream lined motion through a tube of non-uniform cross-section, then the product of the area of cross section and the velocity of flow is same at every point in the tube. Thus, A v A v 1 1 2 2 = or Av = constant or v A \u221d1 This is basically the law of conservation of mass in fluid dynamics.

Hence, dV dt Av = = volume flow rate The mass flow rate is the mass flow per unit time through a cross-section. This is equal to density (\u03c1) times the volume flow rate dV dt .

When an incompressible fluid flows along a tube with varying cross section, its speed must change, and so, an element of fluid must have an acceleration. If the tube is horizontal, the force that causes this acceleration has to be applied by the surrounding fluid. This means that the pressure must be different in regions of different cross section. When a horizontal flow tube narrows and a fluid element speeds up, it must be moving towards a region of lower pressure in order to have a net forward force to accelerate it. If the elevation also changes, this causes additional pressure difference. To derive Bernoulli\u2019s equation, we apply the work-energy theorem to the fluid in a section of the fluid element. Consider the element of fluid that at some initial time lies between two cross sections a and b. The speeds at the lower and upper ends are v1 and v2.In a small time interval, the fluid that is initially at a moves to a\u2032 a distance aa ds v dt \u2032 = = 1 1 and the fluid that is initially at b moves to b\u2032 a distance bb ds v dt \u2032 = = 2 2 .The cross-section areas at the two ends are A1 and A2 as shown. The fluid is incompressible, hence, by the continuity equation, the volume of fluid dV passing through any cross-section during time dt is the same. That is, dV A ds A ds = = 1 1 2 2 Work Done on the Fluid Element Let us calculate the work done on this fluid element during time interval dt. The pressure at the two ends are p1 and p2, the force on the cross section at a is p A 1 1 and the force at b is p A 2 2. The net work done dW on the element by the surrounding fluid during this displacement is, dW p A ds p A ds p p dV = \u2212 = \u2212 1 1 1 2 2 2 1 2 ( ) \u2026(i) The second term is negative, because the force at b opposes the displacement of the fluid. This work dW is due to forces other than the conservative force of gravity, so it equals the change in total mechanical energy (kinetic plus potential). The mechanical energy for the fluid between sections a and b does not change. Change in Potential Energy At the beginning of dt the potential energy for the mass between a and a\u2032 is dmgh dVgh 1 1 = \u03c1 . At the end of dt the potential energy for the mass between b and b\u2032 is dmgh dVgh 2 2 = \u03c1 . The net change in potential energy dU during dt is, dU dV g h h = \u2212 \u03c1( ) ( ) 2 1 \u2026(ii) Change in Kinetic Energy At the beginning of dt the fluid between a and a\u2032 has volume A ds 1 1, mass \u03c1A ds 1 1 and kinetic energy 1 2 1 1 1 2 \u03c1( ) .

It states that the work done on a unit volume of fluid by the surrounding fluid is equal to the sum of the changes in kinetic and potential energies per unit volume that occur during the flow. We can also express Eq. (iv) in a more convenient form as, p gh v p gh v 1 1 1 2 2 2 2 2 1 2 1 2 + + = + + \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 Bernoulli\u2019s equation The subscripts 1 and 2 refer to any two points along the flow tube, so we can also write p gh v + + = \u03c1 \u03c1 1 2 2 constant \u0098 In Bernoulli's equation, there are three terms; p, 1 2 2 \u03c1v and\u03c1gh. Under following three cases, this equation reduces to a two term Bernoulli. Case 1 If all points are open to atmosphere then pressure at every point may be assumed to be constant ( ) = p0 and the Bernoulli equation can be written as, 1 2 2 \u03c1 \u03c1 v gh + = constant At greater heights \u2018h\u2019, speed \u2018v\u2019 will be less as \u03c1 and g are constants. Case 2 If the liquid is passing through a pipe of uniform cross-section, then from continuity equation ( ) Av =constant , speed v is same at all points. Therefore, the Bernoulli equation becomes, p gh + = \u03c1 constant or p gh p gh 1 1 2 2 + = + \u03c1 \u03c1 or p p g h h 1 2 2 1 \u2212 = \u2212 \u03c1 ( ) This is the pressure relation we have already derived for a fluid at rest or pressure decreases with height of liquid and increases with depth of liquid. Case 3 If a liquid is flowing in a horizontal pipe, then height \u2018h\u2019 of the liquid at every point may be assumed to be constant. So, the two term Bernoulli becomes, p v + = 1 2 2 \u03c1 constant From this equation, we may conclude that pressure decreases at a point where speed increases.

This is a result of a lift force acting on the wings of the aircraft. Lift can be generated when an asymmetric object moves through a fluid. The asymmetry of the object requires the fluid particles to travel different distances along different paths as they pass around the object. The molecules will either speed up or slowdown in order to remain even with the fluid molecules on the other side. For example, in Fig. 16.49, the air particles passing along the top of the body must travel a greater distance than those travelling below. In order to arrive at the other side of the foil at the same time, these particles must travel more quickly than those travelling below the foil. The difference in the velocities of the fluid molecules results in a pressure difference according to the Bernoulli principle: high velocities are associated with relatively low pressure regions, while low velocities are associated with relatively high pressure regions. This pressure difference produces a force in upward direction.

When an object spins in a fluid medium, the fluid boundary layer spins along with the object. This results in a difference in velocity on two sides. A pressure difference is created from one side of the object to the other and the object curves towards the area of low pressure. This influence of rotation of an object on its flight path is termed the magnus effect. This magnus force changes the path of a rotating cricket ball. This is called spinning of ball. Blowing Off the Roof during Wind Storm During certain wind storm or cyclone, the roofs of some houses are blown off without damaging the other parts of the house. The high wind blowing over the roof creates a low pressure p2 in accordance with Bernoulli's principle. The pressure p1 below the roof is equal to the atmospheric pressure which is larger than p2. The difference of pressure ( ) p p 1 2 \u2212 causes an upward thrust and the roof is lifted up. Once the roof is lifted up, it is blown off with the wind. Venturimeter Figure shows a venturimeter used to measure flow speed in a pipe of non-uniform cross-section.

A net force to the right accelerates the fluid as it enters the narrow part of the tube (called throat) and a net force to the left slows as it leaves. 432 \u0097 Mechanics - II p1 ",

Viscous forces oppose the motion of one portion of a fluid relative to the other. The simplest example of viscous flow is motion of a fluid between two parallel plates. The bottom plate is stationary and the top plate moves with constant velocity v. The fluid in contact with each surface has same velocity at that surface. The flow speeds of intermediate layers of fluid increase uniformly from bottom to top, as shown by arrows. So, the fluid layers slide smoothly over one another. According to Newton, the frictional force F (or viscous force) between two layers depends upon the following factors, (i) Force F is directly proportional to the area ( ) A of the layers in contact, i.e. F A \u221d (ii) Force F is directly proportional to the velocity gradient dv dy \uf8eb \uf8ed\uf8ec \uf8f6 \uf8f8\uf8f7between the layers. Combining these two, we have F A dv dy \u221d or F A dv dy = \u2212\u03b7 Here, \u03b7is constant of proportionality and is called coefficient of viscosity. Its value depends on the nature of the fluid. The negative sign in the above equation shows that the direction of viscous force F is opposite to the direction of relative velocity of the layer. The SI unit of \u03b7is N-s/m 2. It is also called decapoise or pascal second. Thus, 1 decapoise = 1 N-s /m 2 = 1 Pa-s = 10 poise The SI unit of viscosity is sometimes referred to as the poiseuille (symbol Pl). Thus, 1 Pl =1N-s/m 2 Dimensions of \u03b7are [ML T ] \u20131 \u20131 . Coefficient of viscosity of water at 10\u00b0C is \u03b7 = \u00d7 \u2212 1.3 10 3 N-s/m 2.Experiments show that coefficient of viscosity of a liquid decreases as its temperature rises. 438 \u0097 Mechanics - II F x y v Fig. 16.58  Stoke\u2019s Law and Terminal Velocity When an object moves through a fluid, it experiences a viscous force which acts in opposite direction of its velocity. The mathematics of the viscous force for an irregular object is difficult, we will consider here only the case of a small sphere moving through a fluid. The formula for the viscous force on a sphere was first derived by the English physicist G. Stokes in 1843. According to him, a spherical object of radius r moving at velocity v experiences a viscous force given by F rv = 6\u03c0\u03b7 (\u03b7 = coefficient of viscosity) This law is called Stoke\u2019s law. Terminal Velocity ( ) vT Consider a small sphere falling from rest through a large column of viscous fluid. The forces acting on the sphere are, (i) Weight w of the sphere acting vertically downwards (ii) Upthrust Ft acting vertically upwards (iii) Viscous force Fv acting vertically upwards, i.e. in a direction opposite to velocity of the sphere. Initially, Fv = 0 (as v = 0) and w Ft > and the sphere accelerates downwards. As the velocity of the sphere increases, Fv increases. Eventually a stage in reached when w F F t v = + \u2026(i) After this net force on the sphere is zero and it moves downwards with a constant velocity called terminal velocity ( ) v . T Substituting proper values in Eq. (i) we have, 4 3 4 3 6 3 3 \u03c0 \u03c1 \u03c0 \u03c3 \u03c0\u03b7 r g r g rvT = + \u2026(ii) Here, \u03c1 = density of sphere, \u03c3 = density of fluid and \u03b7 = coefficient of viscosity of fluid From Eq. (ii), we get v r g T = \u2212 2 9 2 ( ) \u03c1 \u03c3 \u03b7 Figure shows the variation of the velocity v of the sphere with time.

So, in that case upthrust will be zero and terminal velocity will be v r g T =2 9 2\u03c1 \u03b7 In this case, weight is equal to the viscous force when terminal velocity is attained. \u0098 If density of fluid is greater than density of sphere (\u03c3>\u03c1) then terminal velocity comes out to be negative. So, in this case terminal velocity is upwards. In the beginning upthrust is greater than the weight. Viscous force in this case will be downwards. v r g T = \u2212 2 9 2( ) \u03c3 \u03c1 \u03b7 When terminal velocity is attained, F W F t v = + This is the reason why, air bubbles rise up in water.

The forces that support the needle are not buoyant forces but are due to surface tension. The surface of a liquid behaves like a membrane under tension. The molecules of the liquid exert attractive forces on each other. There is zero net force on a molecule inside the volume of the liquid.But a surface molecule has a net force towards inside of the liquid. Thus, the liquid tends to minimize its surface area, just as a stretched membrane does. Freely falling raindrops are spherical because a sphere has a smaller surface area for a given volume than any other shape. Hence, the surface tension can be defined as the property of a liquid at rest by virtue of which its free surface behaves like a stretched membrane under tension and tries to occupy as small area as possible. Let an imaginary line AB be drawn in any direction in a liquid surface. The surface on either side of this line exerts a pulling force on the surface on the other side. This force is at right angles to the line AB. The magnitude of this force per unit length of AB is taken as a measure of the surface tension of the liquid. Thus, if F be the total force acting on either side of the line AB of length L, then the surface tension is given by, T F L = Hence, the surface tension of a liquid is defined as the force per unit length in the plane of the liquid surface, acting at right angles on either side of an imaginary line drawn on that surface. Examples of Surface Tension Example 1 Take a ring of wire and dip it in a soap solution. When the ring is taken out, a soap film is formed. Place a loop of thread gently on the soap film. Now, prick a hole inside the loop. The thread is radially pulled by the film surface outside and it takes a circular shape. Reason Before the pricking, there were surfaces both inside and outside the thread loop. Surfaces on both sides pull it equally and the net force is zero. Once the surface inside was punctured, the outside surface pulled the thread to take the circular shape so that area outside the loop becomes minimum (because for given perimeter area of circle is maximum). Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 443 F F A B Fig. 16.64 Fig. 16.65 Fig. 16.63  Example 2 A piece of wire is bent into a U-shape and a second piece of wire slides on the arms of the U. When the apparatus is dipped into a soap solution and removed, a liquid film is formed. The film exerts a surface tension force on the slider and if the frame is kept in a horizontal position, the slider quickly slides towards the closing arm of the frame. If the frame is kept vertical, one can have some weight to keep it in equilibrium. This shows that the soap surface in contact with the slider pulls it parallel to the surface. Example 3 Needle supported on water surface Take a greased needle of steel on a piece of blotting paper and place it gently over the water surface. Blotting paper soaks water and soon sinks down but the needle keeps floating. The floating needle causes a little depression. The forces F and F due to surface tension of the curved surface are inclined as shown in Fig.16.67. The vertical components of these two forces support the weight of the needle. Example 4 Small mercury droplets are spherical and larger ones tend to flatten. Reason Small mercury droplets are spherical because the forces of surface tension tend to reduce their area to a minimum value and a sphere has minimum surface area for a given volume. Larger drops of mercury are flattened due to the large gravitational force acting on them. Here the shape is such that the sum of the gravitational potential energy and the surface potential energy must be minimum. Hence the centre of gravity moves down as low as possible. This explains flattening of the larger drops. Example 5 The hair of a painting brush cling together when taken out of water. Reason This is because the water films formed on them tend to contract to minimum area. Note The surface tension of a particular liquid usually decreases as temperature increases. To wash clothing thoroughly, water must be forced through the tiny spaces between the fibers. This requires increasing the surface area of the water ,which is difficult to do because of surface tension. Hence, hot water and soapy water is better for washing. 444 \u0097 Mechanics - II W Water F F Fig. 16.67 Fig. 16.68 w Fig. 16.66 Fig. 16.69  Surface Energy When the surface area of a liquid is increased, the molecules from the interior rise to the surface. This requires work against force of attraction of the molecules just below the surface. This work is stored in the form of potential energy. Thus, the molecules in the surface have some additional energy due to their position. This additional energy per unit area of the surface is called \u2018surface energy\u2019. The surface energy is related to the surface tension as discussed below. Let a liquid film be formed on a wire frame and a straight wire of length l can slide on this wire frame as shown in figure. The film has two surfaces and both the surfaces are in contact with the sliding wire and hence, exert forces of surface tension on it. If T be the surface tension of the solution, each surface will pull the wire parallel to itself with a force Tl. Thus, net force on the wire due to both the surfaces is 2Tl.One has to apply an external force F equal and opposite to it to keep the wire in equilibrium. Thus, F Tl = 2 Now, suppose the wire is moved through a small distance dx, the work done by the force is, dW F dx Tl dx = = ( ) 2 But ( ) ( ) 2l dx is the total increase in area of both the surfaces of the film. Let it be dA.Then, dW T dA = or T dW dA = or \u2206 \u2206 W A Thus, the surface tension T can also be defined as the work done in increasing the surface area by unity. Further, since there is no change in kinetic energy, the work done by the external force is stored as the potential energy of the new surface. \u2234 T dU dA = or \u2206 \u2206 U A (as dW dU = ) Thus, the surface tension of a liquid is equal to the surface energy per unit surface area. Excess Pressure inside a Bubble or Liquid Drop Surface tension causes a pressure difference between the inside and outside of a soap bubble or a liquid drop. Excess Pressure Inside Soap Bubble A soap bubble consists of two spherical surface films with a thin layer of liquid between them. Because of surface tension, the film tend to contract in an attempt to minimize their surface area. But Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 445 dx F 2Tl Fig. 16.70  as the bubble contracts, it compresses the inside air, eventually increasing the interior pressure to a level that prevents further contraction. We can derive an expression for the excess pressure inside a bubble in terms of its radius R and the surface tension T of the liquid. Each half of the soap bubble is in equilibrium. The lower half is shown in figure. The forces at the flat circular surface where this half joins the upper half are (a) The upward force of surface tension. The total surface tension force for each surface (inner and outer) is T R ( ) 2\u03c0 , for a total of ( )( ) 2 2 T R \u03c0 . (b) downward force due to pressure difference. The magnitude of this force is ( )( ). \u2206p R \u03c0 2 In equilibrium these two forces have equal magnitude. \u2234 ( )( ) ( )( ) 2 2 2 T R P R \u03c0 \u03c0 = \u2206 or \u2206p T R = 4 Note Suppose, the pressure inside the air bubble is P, then p p T R \u2212 = 0 4 Excess Pressure Inside a Liquid Drop A liquid drop has only one surface film. Hence, the surface tension force is T R ( ), 2\u03c0 half that for a soap bubble. Thus, in equilibrium, T R p R ( ) ( ) 2 2 \u03c0 \u03c0 = \u2206 or \u2206p T R = 2 446 \u0097 Mechanics - II P R ",

For small size bubbles this can be assumed. (ii) From the above discussion, we can make a general statement. The pressure on the concave side of a spherical liquid surface is greater than the convex side by 2T R . \u0098 Radius of curvature of a curve : To describe the shape of a curved surface or interface, it is necessary to know the radii of curvature to a curve at some point. Consider the curve AB as shown in figure: Let P be a point on this curve. The radius of curvature R of AB at P is defined as the radius of the circle which is tangent to the curve at point P. \u0098 Principal radii of curvature of a surface : The spherical and cylindrical surfaces are rather simple cases for mathematical treatment. In many other cases however, the shapes are more complicated. Let us now consider a curved surface. At each point on a given surface, two radii of curvature (which are denoted by r1 and r2) are required to describe the shape. If we want to determine these radii at any point (say P), the normal to the surface at this point is drawn and a plane is constructed through the surface containing the normal. This will intersect the surface in a plane curve. The radius of curvature of the curve at point P is denoted by r1. An infinite number of such planes can be constructed each of which intersects the surface at P. For each of these planes, a radius of curvature can be obtained. If we construct a second plane through the surface, containing the normal and perpendicular to the first plane, the second line of intersection and hence the second radius of curvature at point P (i.e., r2) is obtained. These two radii define the curvature at P completely. It can be shown that ( / / ) 1 1 1 2 r r + called mean radius of curvature of the surface is constant, which is independent of the choice of the planes. An infinite set of such pairs of radii is possible. For standardization, the first plane is rotated around the normal until the radius of curvature in that plane reaches minimum. The other radius of curvature is therefore maximum. These are the principal radii of curvature (denoted by R1 and R2). \u0098 Young-Laplace Equation : There exists a difference in pressure across a curved surface which is a consequence of surface tension. The pressure is greater on the concave side. The Laplace equation relates the pressure difference to the shape of the Young surface.

So, we can say that the surface molecules have some extra energy compared to inner molecules and every system has a tendency to keep its energy minimum. So, a liquid also has a tendency to keep its energy minimum by putting least number of molecules on the surface or by making its surface area minimum. This property of a liquid is called surface tension. \u0098 Surface tension is a property of a liquid. It does not depend on the surface area. For example, both containers have the same liquid under same conditions. A A 2 1 > but surface tension will be same in both cases.

Find pressure inside the air bubble for the condition r h << . 16.10 Capillary Rise or Fall Cohesive and Adhesive Forces The force of attraction between the molecules of the same substance is called cohesion. In case of solids, the force of cohesion is very large and due to this solids have definite shape and size. On the other hand, the force of cohesion in case of liquids is weaker than that of solids. Hence, liquids do not have definite shape but have definite volume. The force of cohesion is negligible in case of gases. Because of this fact, gases have neither fixed shape nor volume. Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 451 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 16.7  Examples (i) Two drops of liquid coalesce into one when brought in mutual contact because of the cohesive force. (ii) It is difficult to separate two sticky plates of glass wetted with water because a large force has to be applied against the cohesive force between the molecules of water. (iii) It is very difficult to break a drop of mercury into small droplets because of large cohesive force between mercury molecules. The force of attraction between molecules of different substance is called adhesion. Examples (i) Adhesive force enables us to write on the black board with a chalk. (ii) Due to force of adhesion, water wets the glass plate. (iii) Fevicol and gum are used in gluing two surfaces together because of adhesive force. Contact Angle When a liquid surface touches a solid surface, the shape of the liquid surface near the contact is generally curved. When a glass plate is immersed in water, the surface near the plate becomes concave. On the other hand, if glass plate is immersed in mercury, the surface is depressed near the plate. The angle between the tangent planes at the solid surface and the liquid at the contact is called the contact angle. In this case the tangent plane to the solid surface is to be drawn towards the liquid and the tangent plane to the liquid is to be drawn away from the solid. Those liquids which wet the walls of the container (say in case of water and glass) have meniscus concave upwards and their values of angle of contact is less than 90\u00b0 (also called acute angle). However, those liquids which don't wet the walls of the container (say in case of mercury and glass) have meniscus convex upwards and their value of angle of contact is greater than 90\u00b0 (also called obtuse angle). The angle of contact of mercury with glass is about 140\u00b0, whereas the angle of contact of water with glass is about 8\u00b0. But, for pure water, the angle of contact \u03b8 with glass is taken as 0\u00b0. Shape of Liquid Meniscus When the adhesive force ( ) P between solid and liquid molecules is more than the cohesive force ( ) Q between liquid-liquid molecules (as with water and glass), shape of the meniscus is concave and the angle of contact \u03b8 is less than 90\u00b0. In this case, the liquid wets or adheres to the solid surface. The resultant ( ) R of P and Q passes through the solid. 452 \u0097 Mechanics - II \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 > 90\u00b0 \u03b8 < 90\u00b0 Fig. 16.79 Glass R P Q Water Fig. 16.80  On the other hand when P Q < (as with glass and mercury), shape of the meniscus is convex and the angle of contact \u03b8 > \u00b0 90 . The resultant ( ) R of P and Q in this case passes through the liquid. Let us now see why the liquid surface bends near the contact with a solid. A liquid in equilibrium can not sustain tangential stress. The resultant force on any small part of the surface layer must be perpendicular to the surface at that point. Basically three forces are acting on a small part of the liquid surface near its contact with solid. These forces are, (i) P, attraction due to the molecule of the solid surface near it (ii) Q, attraction due to liquid molecules near this part and (iii) The weight w of the part considered. We have considered very small part, so weight of that part can be ignored for better understanding. As we have seen in the last figures, to make the resultant ( ) R of P and Q perpendicular to the liquid surface the surface becomes curved (convex or concave). Capillarity Surface tension causes elevation or depression of the liquid in a narrow tube. This effect is called capillarity. When a glass capillary tube (A tube of very small diameter is called a capillary tube) open at both ends is dipped vertically in water the water in the tube will rise above the level of water in the vessel as shown in figure (a). In case of mercury, the liquid is depressed in the tube below the level of mercury in the vessel as shown in figure (b). When the contact angle is less than 90\u00b0 the liquid rises in the tube. For a non-wetting liquid angle of contact is greater than 90\u00b0 and the surface is depressed, pulled down by the surface tension forces. Explanation When a capillary tube is dipped in water, the water meniscus inside the tube is concave. The pressure just below the meniscus is less than the pressure just above it by 2T R , where T is the surface tension of water and R is the radius of curvature of the meniscus. The pressure on the surface of water is p0, the atmospheric pressure. The pressure just below the plane surface of water outside the tube is also Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 453 (a) (b) Fig. 16.82 Glass R P Mercury Q Fig. 16.81  p0, but that just below the meniscus inside the tube is p T R 0 2 \u2212 .We know that pressure at all points in the same level of water must be the same. Therefore, to make up the deficiency of pressure 2T R below the meniscus water begins to flow from outside into the tube. The rising of water in the capillary stops at a certain height h. In this position, the pressure of water column of height h becomes equal to 2T R , i.e. h g T R \u03c1 = 2 or h T R g = 2 \u03c1 If r is the radius of the capillary tube and \u03b8 the angle of contact, then R r = cos \u03b8 \u2234 h T r g = 2 cos \u03b8 \u03c1 Alternative Proof for the Formula of Capillary Rise As we have already seen, when the contact angle is less than 90\u00b0, the total surface tension force just balances the extra weight of the liquid in the tube. The water meniscus in the tube is along a circle of circumference 2\u03c0r which is in contact with the glass. Due to the surface tension of water, a force equal to T per unit length acts at all points of the circle. If the angle of contact is \u03b8, then this force is directed inward at an angle \u03b8 from the wall of the tube. In accordance with Newton\u2019s third law, the tube exerts an equal and opposite force T per unit length on the circumference of the water meniscus. This force which is directed outward, can be resolved into two components T cos \u03b8 per unit length acting vertically upward and T sin \u03b8 per unit length acting horizontally outward. Considering the entire circumference 2\u03c0r, for each horizontal component T sin \u03b8 there is an equal and opposite component and the two neutralise each other. The vertical components being in the same direction are added up to give a total upward force ( )( cos ). 2\u03c0 \u03b8 r T It is this force which supports the weight of the water column so raised. 454 \u0097 Mechanics - II R \u03b8 \u03b8 r Fig. 16.83 T r cos (2 ) \u03b8 \u03c0 \u03b8 h \u03b8 \u03b8 \u03b8 T cos \u03b8 T T T sin \u03b8 T sin \u03b8 T cos \u03b8 Fig. 16.84  Thus, ( cos )( ) T r \u03b8 \u03c0 2 = Weight of the liquid column. = ( ) \u03c0 \u03c1 r gh 2 \u2026(i) \u2234 h T r g = 2 cos \u03b8 \u03c1 The result has following notable features : (i) If the contact angle\u03b8 is greater than 90\u00b0, the termcos \u03b8 is negative and hence, h is negative. The expression then gives the depression of the liquid in the tube. (ii) The correction due to weight of the liquid contained in the meniscus can be made for contact angle \u03b8 = \u00b0 0 .The meniscus is then hemispherical.

But if the length of the tube is insufficient (i.e. less than h) say h\u2032, the liquid does not emerge in the form of a fountain from the upper end (because it will violate the law of conservation of energy) but the angle made by the liquid surface and hence, the R changes in such a way that the force 2\u03c0 \u03b8 rT cos equals the weight of the liquid raised.

Application on Surface Tension (i) When the detergent materials are added to liquids, the angle of contact decreases and hence the wettability increases. On the other hand, when water proofing material is added to a fabric it increases the angle of contact, making the fabric water-repellant. (ii) Surface tension of all lubricating oils and paints is kept low so that they spread over a large area. (iii) Oil spreads over the surface of water because the surface tension of oil is less than the surface tension of cold water. 2. Effect of Temperature and Impurities on Surface Tension The surface tension of a liquid decreases with the rise in temperature and vice-versa. Surface tension becomes zero at a critical temperature. It is for this reason that hot soup tastes better. Surface tension of a liquid changes appreciably with addition of impurities. For example, surface tension of water increases with addition of highly soluble substances like Nacl, ZnSO4 etc. On the other hand surface tension of water gets reduced with addition of sparingly soluble substances like phenol, soap etc. 3. Laminar and Turbulent Flow, Reynolds Number When a liquid flowing in a pipe is observed carefully, it will be seen that the pattern of flow becomes more disturbed as the velocity of flow increases. Perhaps this phenomenon is more commonly seen in a river or stream. When the flow is slow the pattern is smooth, but when the flow is fast, eddies develop and swirl in all directions. At the low velocities, flow is calm. This is called \u201claminar flow\u201d. In a series of experiments, Reynolds showed this by injecting a thin stream of dye into the fluid and finding that it ran in a smooth stream in the direction of the flow at low speeds. As the velocity of flow increased, he found that the smooth line of dye was broken up, at high velocities, the dye was rapidly mixed into the disturbed flow of the surrounding fluid. This is called \u201cturbulent flow\u201d. After many experiments Reynolds saw that the expression \u03c1 \u03b7 ud where, \u03c1 = density, u = mean velocity, d = diameter and \u03b7 = viscosity would help in predicting the change in flow type. If the value is less than about 2000 then flow is laminar, if greater than 4000 then turbulent and in between these two in the transition zone. This value is known as the Reynolds number, Re. Re = \u03c1 \u03b7 ud Laminar flow: Re < 2000,  Transitional flow: 2000 4000 < < Re ,  Turbulent flow: Re > 4000 SI Units of Reynolds Number \u03c1 = = kg m m/s / 3, u , d m = , \u03b7 = = Ns m kg ms / / 2 R kg/m m/s m kg/ms e = = = \u03c1 \u03b7 ud ( )( )( ) ( ) 3 1 i.e. it has no units. A quantity that has no units is known as a non-dimensional (or dimensionless) quantity. Thus, the Reynolds number, Re is a non-dimensional number.

Weight of solid = Upthrust on solid \u2234 V g V g s i l \u03c1 \u03c1 = Here, V is total volume of solid and Vi is immersed volume of solid. \u2234 V V f i i s l = = \u03c1 \u03c1 Here, f1 is immersed fraction of volume of solid.

Upthrust on immersed volume in figure (i) is equal to weight of block-1 and upthrust on immersed volume in figure (ii) is equal to weight of both the blocks 1 and 2. In other words, we can also say that upthrust on extra immersed volume in figure (ii) is equal to extra weight. In equation form, we can write as m g V g i l 1 1 = ( ) \u03c1 and ( ) ( ) m m g V g i l 1 2 2 + = \u03c1 or m g V V g i i l 2 2 1 = \u2212 [( ) ( ) ]\u03c1 or ( ) \u2206m g or \u2206 \u2206 w V g i l = ( )\u03c1 Note If fluid is accelerated, then in the expression of upthrust g is replaced be geff. V Example 1 A block of wood floats in a bucket of water placed in a lift. Will the block sink more or less if the lift starts accelerating up? Solution Under nromal conditions, fraction of volume immersed under floating condition is f s l 1 = \u03c1 \u03c1 \u2026(i) If the lift starts accelerating up, then upthrust \u2212weight = ma \u2234 V g a V g V a i l s s \u03c1 \u03c1 \u03c1 ( ) + \u2212 = Solving this equation, we get V V f i s l = = 2 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u2026(ii) f f 1 2 = So, the block neither sinks less nor more.

Concept Let us first note down the following four results: (i) If ice is floating in water, then after melting of ice the level \u2018h\u2019 remains unchanged. (ii) In floating to floating condition level \u2018h\u2019 remains unchanged. For example Suppose some wooden blocks are floating in water kept inside a boat. If these wooden blocks are thrown into the water, then level will remain unchanged. This is because under both the conditions wooden blocks are floating. (iii) In the floating to sink condition, level \u2018h\u2019 decreases. For example In the above case if wooden blocks are replaced by stone pieces then level will fall. Because, initially stone pieces were floating (with the help of boat) but eventually those pieces will sink. (iv) A solid is floating in a liquid of density \u03c11. After sometime, the solid melts and density (of solid) after melting (in liquid state) is suppose \u03c12, then there are following three cases : Case 1 If \u03c1 \u03c1 2 1 = , then level remains unchanged. Note that this is also result (i). Case 2 If \u03c1 <\u03c1 2 1, then level will increase. Case 3 If \u03c1 >\u03c1 2 1, then level will decrease. V Example 3 A piece of ice is floating in a glass vessel filled with water. Then prove that level of water in the vessel remains unchanged after melting of ice . Note This is result (i). Solution Let m be the mass of ice piece floating in water. In equilibrium, weight of ice piece upthrust = or mg V g i w = \u03c1 or V m i w = \u03c1 \u2026(i) Chapter 16 Fluid Mechanics \u0097 461 h  Here, Vi is the volume of ice piece immersed in water. When the ice melts, let V be the volume of water formed by m mass of ice. Then, V m w = \u03c1 \u2026(ii) From Eqs. (i) and (ii), we see that V V i = Hence, the level will not change. Ans. V Example 4 A piece of ice having a stone frozen in it floats in a glass vessel filled with water. How will the level of water in the vessel change when the ice melts? Note This is result (iii). Solution Let, m1 = mass of ice, m2 = mass of stone \u03c1S = density of stone and \u03c1w = density of water In equilibrium, when the piece of ice floats in water, weight of ice stone upthrust ( ) + = or ( ) m m g V g i w 1 2 + = \u03c1 \u2234 V m m i w w = + 1 2 \u03c1 \u03c1 \u2026(i) Here, Vi = Volume of ice immersed When the ice melts, m1 mass of ice converts into water and stone of mass m2 is completely submerged. Volume of water formed by m1 mass of ice, V m w 1 1 = \u03c1 Volume of stone (which is also equal to the volume of water displaced) V m S 2 2 = \u03c1 Since, \u03c1 \u03c1 S w > Therefore, V V Vi 1 2 + < or   the level of water will decrease. Ans. V Example 5 A solid floats in a liquid of different material. Carry out an analysis to see whether the level of liquid in the container will rise or fall when the solid melts. Note This is result (iv). Solution Let M = Mass of the floating solid \u03c12 = density of liquid formed by the melting of the solid \u03c11 = density of the liquid in which the solid is floating The mass of liquid displaced by the solid is M. Hence, the volume of liquid displaced is M \u03c11 . 462 \u0097 Mechanics - II  When the solid melts, the volume occupied by it is M \u03c12 . Hence, the level of liquid in container will rise or fall according as M \u03c12 > or < M \u03c11 i.e. \u03c12 < or > \u03c11 There will be no change in the level if \u03c1 \u03c1 1 2 = . In case of ice, floating in water \u03c1 \u03c1 1 2 = and hence, the level of water remains unchanged when ice melts. Type 3. Based on apparent weight or change in weight of a solid inside a liquid. Concept If density of a solid is greater than density of liquid then it cannot float, it will sink. In this case, we hold the solid inside the liquid. Upthrust acts on its 100% volume and the solid is felt lighter. The equations are as under. w w app actual = \u2212Upthrust on 100% volume or change in weight \u2206w= Upthrust =V g l \u03c1 \u2026(i) From Eq. (i) we come across following two results: (i) If the liquid in which solid is immersed, is water, then Weight in air Decrease in weight Relative density o = f body (RD) This can be shown as under Weight in air Decrease in weight Weight in air Upthr = ust in water = V g V g S w \u03c1 \u03c1 = \u03c1 \u03c1 S w = RD Hence proved. (ii) Change in weight \u2206w is directly proportional to density of liquid or relative density of liquid. Thus, \u2206w l \u221d\u03c1 or ( ) RD l \u21d2 \u2206 \u2206 w w l l l l l 1 2 2 1 = = ( ) ) ( ) ( ) \u03c1 (\u03c1 ",

Type 6. Based on pressure force and its torque. Concept p F A = \u21d2 F pA = Let us call this force as the pressure force. Now, this force is calculated on a surface. If surface is horizontal then pressure is uniform at all points. So, F pA = can be applied directly. For calculation of torque, point of application of force is required. In the above case, point of application of force may be assumed at geometrical centre of the surface. If the surface is vertical or inclined, pressure is non-uniform (it increases with depth) so pressure force and its torque can be obtained by integration. After finding force and torque by integration, we can also find point of application of this force by the relation. r F \u22a5= \u03c4 (as \u03c4 = \u00d7 F r1) V Example 14 A liquid of density \u03c1 is filled upto a height of \u2018h\u2019 in a container as shown in figure.

It is increasing with depth. F1 and F2 and their points of application are shown in figure below. Note In the figure shown, torque of hydrostatic force about point O, the centre of a semicylindrical (or hemispherical) gate is zero as the hydrostatic force at all points passes through point O. Type 7. Based on the concept of pressure force and upthrust. Concept (i) Pressure in a fluid (gas or a liquid) increases with depth. At a height (or depth) difference of h change in pressure is \u2206p gh = \u00b1\u03c1 . Here, \u03c1 is the density of fluid. Now, density of air is almost negligible, so for small height differences it is almost constant ( ) = p0 . Therefore, value of atmospheric pressure is almost same everywhere. But this is not the case with a liquid, whose density is not negligible. (ii) If a solid is floating in a liquid then net pressure force (including p A 0 ) on this solid is upwards. This force is called upthrust and this is numerically equal to V g i l \u03c1 and in equilibrium this is equal to weight of the solid.

A plank of area of cross-section A is floating in two liquids. h1 height of the plank is immersed in first liquid and h2 height in second liquid. Atmospheric pressures is constant at small height differences. So F1 and F2 forces shown in the figure can be obtained directly( pressure area) = \u00d7 .
