Each question has four choices (1), (2), (3) and  (4), out of which ONLY ONE option is correct.     Q61.  The correct order of the first ionization enthalpy is    (A) B > Al > Ga  (B) Ga > Al> B    (C) Al > Ga > Tl  (D) Tl > Ga > Al  Ans.  D  Sol.  Due to lanlhanide contraction ionization energy of T\uf06c is more than Ga & A\uf06c    Incase of Ga there are 10 d electrons in penultimate shell which screen nuclear charge less  effectively and thus outer electron held firmly by the nucleus ionisation energy of Ga is slightly  greater than A\uf06c.    Q62.  Given below are two statements:    Statement I : The correct order of first ionization enthalpy values of Li,Na, F and Cl is Na< Li < Cl  <F.    Statement II: The correct order of negative electron gain enthalpy vaues of Li, Na, F and  Cl is Na  < Li < F < Cl    In the light of the above statements, choose the correct answer from the options given below:    (A) Statement I is false but Statement II is true.    (B) Statement I  is true but Statement II is false.    (C) Both Statement I and Statement II are true.    (D) Both Statement I and Statement II are false.  Ans.  C  Sol.  Ionisation energy increases from left to right in period and decrease down the group so for  ionization energy Na< Li < Cl < F in general the electron gain enthalpy become less negative  from top to bottom in a group. In case of F & Cl electron gain enthalpy of Cl is more negative than  F because in case of F we have 7 electrons in smaller second shell as result there is strong enter  electronic repulsion when extra electron is added. So for  electron gain enthalpy Na < Li < F < Cl    Q63.  A first row transition metal in its +2 oxidation state has a spin-only magnetic moment value of  3.86BM. The atomic number of the metal is.
