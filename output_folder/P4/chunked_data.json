JEE  Advanced Understanding Physics  JEE Main & Advanced   This book is dedicated to my honourable grandfather  (Late) Sh. Pitamber Pandey a Kumaoni poet and a resident of Village  Dhaura (Almora), Uttarakhand  Understanding Physics  JEE Main & Advanced    29.1 Introduction 29.2 Displacement Current 29.3 Electromagnetic Waves 29.4 Electromagnetic Spectrum  29.1 Introduction Earlier we have learned that a time varying magnetic field produces an electric field. Is the converse also true? Does a time varying electric field can produce a magnetic field? James Clerk Maxwell argued that not only an electric current but also a time varying electric field generates magnetic field. Maxwell formulated a set of equations (known as Maxwell\u2019s equations) involving electric and magnetic fields. Maxwell\u2019s equations and Lorentz force formula make all the basic laws of electromagnetism. The most important outcome of Maxwell\u2019s equations is the existence of electromagnetic waves. The changing electric and magnetic fields form the basis of electromagnetic waves. A combination of time varying electric and magnetic fields (referred as electromagnetic wave) propagate in space very close to the speed of light (= \u00b4 3 108 m/s) obtained from optical measurements. We shall take a brief discussion of electromagnetic waves mainly developed by Maxwell around 1864. 29.2 Displacement Current An electric current produces magnetic field. Value of magnetic field (due to an electric current) at some point can be obtained by Biot-Savart law or Ampere\u2019s circuital law. We have stated Ampere\u2019s law as B\u00d7 = \u00f2 d i l m 0 ...(i) where left hand side of this equation is the line integral of magnetic field over a closed path and iis the electric current crossing the surface bounded by that closed path. Ampere\u2019s law in this form is not valid if the electric field at the surface varies with time. For an example if we place a magnetic needle in between the plates of a capacitor during its charging or discharging then it deflects. Although, there is no current between the plates, so magnetic field should be zero. Hence, the needle should not show any deflection. But deflection of needle shows that there is a magnetic field in the region between plates of capacitor during charging or discharging. So, there must be some other source (other than current) of magnetic field. This other source is nothing but the changing electric field. Because at the time of charging or discharging of capacitor electric field between the plates changes. The relation between the changing electric field and the magnetic field resulting from it is given by B l \u00d7 = e \u00f2 d d dt E m f 0 0 ...(ii) Here,f E is the flux of the electric field through the area bounded by the closed path along which line integral of B is calculated. Combining Eqs. (i) and (ii), we can make a general expression of Ampere\u2019s circuital law and that is B l \u00d7 = + e \u00f2 d i d dt E m m f 0 0 0 = + e \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7 m f 0 0 i d dt E or B l \u00d7 = + \u00f2 d i id m 0 ( ) ...(iii) 2 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  Here, i d dt d E = e 0 f ...(iv) is called the displacement current and which is produced by the change in electric field. The current due to the flow of charge is often called conduction current and is denoted by ic.Thus, Eq. (iii) can also be written as B l \u00d7 = + \u00f2 d i i c d m 0 ( ) ...(v) Example In the figure, a capacitor is charged by a battery through a resistance R. Charging of capacitor will be exponential. A time varying charging current iflows in the circuit (due to flow of charge) till charging continues. A time varying electric field is also produced between the plates. This causes a displacement current id between the plates. There is no current between the plates due to flow of charge, as a medium between the plates is insulator. Consider two closed paths a and b as shown in figure. Ampere\u2019s circuital law in these two paths is Along path a B l \u00d7 = \u00f2 d i m 0 or B l \u00d7 = \u00f2 d ic m 0 Along path b B l \u00d7 = \u00f2 d id m 0 Here, i d dt d E = e 0 f is in the direction shown in figure. In sample example 29.1, we have shown that i i c d = Faraday\u2019s law of electromagnetic induction says that changing magnetic field gives rise to an electric field and its line integral ( ) = emf is given by the equation E l \u00d7 = - \u00f2 d d dt B f A changing electric field gives rise to a magnetic field is the symmetrical counterpart of Faraday\u2019s law. This is a consequence of the displacement current and given by B l \u00d7 = e \u00f2 d d dt E m f 0 0 = m 0 id Thus, time dependent electric and magnetic fields give rise to each other.

Charges in uniform motion (or steady currents) produce both electric and magnetic fields. Accelerated charges radiate electromagnetic waves. It is an important result of Maxwell\u2019s theory. Thus, an accelerated charge produces all three electric field, magnetic field and electromagnetic waves. Consider an oscillating charged particle. Let f is the frequency of its oscillations. This oscillating charged particle produces an oscillating electric field (of same frequency f ). Now, this oscillating electric field becomes a source of oscillating magnetic field (Ampere-Maxwell\u2019s law). This oscillating magnetic field again becomes a source of oscillating electric field (Faraday\u2019s law) and so on. The oscillating electric and magnetic fields regenerate each other and electromagnetic wave propagates through the space. The frequency of the electromagnetic wave is equal to the frequency of oscillation of the charge. Frequency of visible light is of the order of1014 Hz, while the maximum frequency that we can get with modern electronic circuits is of the order of1011 Hz. Therefore, it is difficult to experimentally demonstrate the production of visible light. Hertz\u2019s experiment (in 1887) demonstrated the production of electromagnetic waves of low frequency (in radio wave region). Jagdish Chandra Bose succeeded in producing the electromagnetic waves of much higher frequency in the laboratory. \u0098 When electromagnetic waves propagate in space then electric and magnetic fields oscillate in mutually perpendicular directions. Further, they are perpendicular to the direction of propagation of electromagnetic wave also. \u0098 Consider a plane electromagnetic wave propagating along the z-direction. The electric field Ex is along the x-axis and varies sinusoidally. The magnetic field By is along the y-axis and again varies sinusoidally. We can write Ex and By as E E t kz x = - 0 sin ( ) w and B B t kz y = - 0 sin ( ) w Thus, electromagnetic wave travels in the direction of E B \u00b4 . \u0098 From Maxwell\u2019s equations and the knowledge of waves we can write the following expressions, k = 2p l and w p = 2 f Speed of light (in vacuum) c k f E B = = = = e w l m 0 0 0 0 1 where, f is the frequency of electromagnetic wave and l its wavelength. Chapter 29 Electromagnetic Waves \u0097 5 Extra Points to Remember Wavelength Electric field Direction of wave Magnetic field Fig. 29.3  \u0098 Unlike a mechanical wave (like sound wave) an electromagnetic wave does not require any material medium for the oscillations of electric and magnetic fields. They can travel in vacuum also. Oscillations of electric and magnetic fields are self sustaining in free space or vacuum. \u0098 In a material medium (like glass, water etc.), electric and magnetic fields are different from the external fields. They are described in terms of permittivity eand magnetic permeabilitym. In Maxwell\u2019s equations, e0 and m 0 are thus replaced by e and m and the velocity of light becomes, v = e 1 m Thus, the velocity of light depends on electric and magnetic properties of the medium. \u0098 Like other waves, electromagnetic waves also carry energy and momentum.In previous chapters, we have studied that, energy density in electric field = e 1 2 0 2 E and  energy density in magnetic field = \u00d7 ",

Therefore, energy density is associated with both the fields. \u0098 Consider a plane perpendicular to the direction of propagation of the electromagnetic wave. If the total energy transferred to a surface in time t is E, then total momentum delivered to this surface for complete absorption is D p E c = (complete absorption) If the wave is totally reflected, the momentum delivered is D p E c = 2 (completely reflected) \u0098 The energy transferred per unit area per unit time perpendicular to the direction of propagation of electromagnetic wave is called the intensity of wave. It is given by I E c = e 1 2 0 2 Here, E is the rms value of electric field or Erms. V Example 29.2 A plane electromagnetic wave of frequency 25 MHz travels in free space along the x-direction.

Find the energy contained in a cylinder of cross-section 10 2 cm and length 50 cm along the x-axis. 29.4 Electromagnetic Spectrum The basic source of electromagnetic wave is an accelerated charge. This produces the changing electric and magnetic fields which constitute an electromagnetic wave. An electromagnetic wave may have its wavelength varying from zero to infinity. Not all of them are known till date. Today, we are familiar with electromagnetic waves having wavelengths as small as 30 1 10 15 fm fm m ( ) = - to as large as 30 km. The boundaries separating different regions of spectrum are not sharply defined, with visible light ranging from 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5. An approximate range of wavelengths associated with each colour are violet ( ) 4000 4500 \u00c5 \u00c5 - , blue ( ) 4500 5200 \u00c5 \u00c5 - , green ( ) 5200 5600 \u00c5 \u00c5 - , yellow ( ) 5600 6000 \u00c5 \u00c5 - , orange ( ) 6000 6250 \u00c5 \u00c5 - and red ( ) 6250 7000 \u00c5 \u00c5 - . The classification of electromagnetic waves according to frequency or wavelength is called electromagnetic spectrum. Table below gives range of wavelengths and frequencies for different waves. Table 29.1 S.No. Type Wavelength range Frequency range 1. Radio waves > 01. m < \u00b4 3 109 Hz 2. Micro waves 0.1 m to 1 mm 3 10 3 10 9 11 \u00b4 \u00b4 Hz to Hz 3.

X-rays 10 \u00c5 to 0.01 \u00c5 3 10 3 10 17 20 \u00b4 \u00b4 Hz to Hz 7. Gamma rays < 0.01 \u00c5 > \u00b4 3 1020 Hz Note In the above table, wavelength is decreasing from top to bottom. But, frequency is increasing. Now, let us discuss them in brief in the order of increasing wavelength. 1. Gamma Rays These high frequency radiations are usually produced in nuclear reactions and also emitted by radioactive nuclei. They are used in medicines to destroy cancer cells. 2. X-Rays X-rays were discovered in 1895 by W.Roentgen. These are produced by the rapid deceleration of electrons that bombard a heavy metal target. These are also produced by electronic transitions between the energy levels in an atom. X-rays are used as a diagnostic tool in medicine and as a treatment for certain forms of cancer. 3. Ultraviolet Rays Ultraviolet radiation is produced by special lamps and very hot bodies. The sun is an important source of ultraviolet light. It plays an important role in the production of vitamin-D. But prolonged doses of UV radiation can induce skin cancers in human beings. Ozone layer in atmosphere at an altitude of about 40-50 km plays a protective role in this regarding. Depletion of this layer by chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) gas (such as Freon) is a matter of international concern now a days. 4. Visible Light It is most familiar form of electromagnetic waves.Our eye is sensitive to visible light. Visible light emitted or reflected from objects around us provides information about world. Process of photosynthesis in plants needs visible light. Visible light is produced by the transition of electrons in an atom from one energy level to other. 5. Infrared Radiation Infrared rays also sometimes referred as heat waves are produced by hot bodies. They are perceived by us as heat. In most of the materials, water molecules are present. These molecules readily absorb infrared rays. After absorption, their thermal motion increases, i.e. they heat up and heat their surroundings. Infrared rays are used for early detection of tumors. Infrared detectors are also used to observe growth of crops and for military purposes. 6. Microwaves Microwaves may be generated by the oscillations of electrons in a device called klystron. Microwave ovens are used in kitchens. In microwave ovens frequency of the microwaves is selected to match the resonant frequency of water molecules so that energy from the waves is transferred to the kinetic energy of the molecules. This raises the temperature of any food containing water. 7. Radio Waves Radio waves are generated when charges are accelerating through conducting wires. They are generated in L C - oscillators and are used in radio and television communication systems. 10 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  \u0098 Our eyes are sensitive to visible light (lbetween 4000 \u00c5 to7000 \u00c5). Similarly, different animals are sensitive to different ranges of wavelengths. For example, snakes can detect infrared waves. \u0098 The basic difference between different types of electromagnetic waves lies in their frequencies and wavelengths. All of them travel with same speed in vacuum. Further they differ in their mode of interaction with matter. For example infrared waves vibrate the electrons, atoms and molecules of a substance. These vibrations increase the internal energy and temperature of the substance. This is why infrared waves are also called heat waves. \u0098 Electromagnetic waves interact with matter via their electric and magnetic fields, which set in oscillation with the charges present in all matter. This interaction depends on the wavelength of the electromagnetic wave and the nature of atoms or molecules in the medium. \u0098 Microwave Oven In electromagnetic spectrum frequency and energy of microwaves is smaller than the visible light. Water content is required for cooking food in microwave oven. Almost all food items contain some water content. Microwaves interact with water molecules and atoms via their electric and magnetic fields. Temperature of water molecules increases by this. These water molecules share this energy with neighboring food molecules, heating up the food. Porcelain vessels are used for cooking food in microwave oven. Because its large molecules vibrate and rotate with much smaller frequencies and do not get heated up. We cannot use metal vessels. Metal vessels interact with microwaves. These vessels may melt due to heating. Chapter 29 Electromagnetic Waves \u0097 11 Extra Points to Remember  V Example 1 Long distance radio broadcasts use short wave bands. Explain why? Solution Short radio waves are reflected by ionosphere. V Example 2 It is necessary to use satellites for long distance TV transmission. Explain why? Solution TV waves (part of radio waves) range from 54 MHz to 890 MHz. Unlike short wave bands (used in radio broadcasts) which are reflected by ionosphere, TV waves are not properly reflected by ionosphere. This is why, satellites are used for long distance TV transmission. V Example 3 The ozone layer on the top of the stratosphere is crucial for human survival. Explain why? Solution Ozone layer protects ourselves from ultraviolet radiations. Over exposure to UV radiation can cause skin cancer in human beings. Ozone layer absorbs UV radiations. But unfortunately over use of Chlorofluoro Carbon Gases (CFCs) is depleting this ozone layer and it is a matter of international concern now a days. V Example 4 Optical and radio telescopes are built on ground but X-ray astronomy is possible only from satellites orbiting the earth. Explain why? Solution Visible and radio waves can penetrate the atmosphere, while X-rays are absorbed by the atmosphere. This is why X-ray telescopes are installed in satellites orbiting the earth. V Example 5 If the earth did not have an atmosphere, would its average surface temperature be higher or lower than what it is now? Solution Due to presence of atmosphere green house effect takes place. Heat radiated by earth is trapped due to green house effect. In the absence of atmosphere, temperature of the earth would be lower because the green house effect of the atmosphere would be absent. V Example 6 Some scientists have predicted the global nuclear war on the earth would be followed by a severe nuclear winter with a devastating effect on life on earth. What might be the basis of this prediction? Solution After nuclear war, clouds would perhaps cover the atmosphere of earth preventing solar light from reaching many parts of earth. This would cause a winter. V Example 7 Why is the orientation of the portable radio with respect to broadcasting station important? Solution Electromagnetic waves are plane polarised, so the receiving antenna should be parallel to electric and magnetic part of wave. Solved Examples  V Example 8 A plane electromagnetic wave propagating in the x-direction has a wavelength of 5.0 mm. The electric field is in the y-direction and its maximum magnitude is 30 1 Vm- .

Light is the principal means by which we gain knowledge of the world. Consequently, the nature of light has been the source of one of the longest debates in the history of science. Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths in the range of about 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5, to which eye is sensitive is called light. In the present and next two chapters we investigate the behaviour of a beam of light when it encounters simple optical devices like mirrors, lenses and apertures. Under many circumstances, the wavelength of light is negligible compared with the dimensions of the device as in the case of ordinary mirrors and lenses. A light beam can then be treated as a ray whose propagation is governed by simple geometric rules. The part of optics that deals with such phenomena is known as geometric optics. However, if the wavelength is not negligible compared with the dimensions of the device (for example a very narrow slit), the ray approximation becomes invalid and we have to examine the behaviour of light in terms of its wave properties. This study is known as physical optics. 30.2 General Concepts used in Geometrical Optics Some general concepts which are used in whole geometrical optics are given below. 1. Normal incidence means angle of incidence (with normal) is 0\u00b0. If angle of incidence is 90\u00b0, it is called grazing incidence. 2. An image is formed either by reflection or refraction. Minimum two (reflected or refracted) rays are required for image formation. More the number of rays, more will be the intensity of image. 3. A light is reflected only from a silvered surface. Without any reflecting surface on the path of ray of light it keeps on moving ahead. In figure (i) For image formation, if reflected ray-p is required to the left of concave lens, then we will take it as dotted line. 22 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics 90\u00b0 Normal incidence = 0\u00b0 \u00d0i Grazing incidence = 90\u00b0 \u00d0i Fig. 30.1 p q (i) (ii) Fig. 30.2  In figure (ii) For image formation, if reflected ray-q is required to the right of concave mirror, then we will take it as dotted line. 4. Real object, virtual object, real image, virtual image The point where the rays meet (or appear to meet) before refraction or reflection is called object and the point where the rays meet (or appear to meet) after refraction or reflection is called image. Further, object (or image) is real if dark lines meet and virtual if dotted lines meet. In figure (a), object is real, while image is virtual. In figure (b), object is virtual while its image is real. In figure (c), the object O is real. Its image formed by the lens (i.e. I1) is real. But, it acts as a virtual object for mirror which forms its real image I 2. 5. The virtual images cannot be taken on screen. But, they can be seen by our eye. Because our eye lens forms their real image on our retina. Thus, if we put a screen at I in the above figure (a) no image will be formed on it. At the same time if we put the screen at I in figure (b), image will be formed. 6. Normally, the object is kept on the left hand side of the optical instrument (mirror, lens etc.), i.e. the ray of light travels from left to right. Sometimes, it may happen that the light is travelling in opposite direction. See the figure. Chapter 30 Reflection of Light \u0097 23 (a) O (b) O I (c) ",

Sign convention The distances measured along the incident light are taken as positive while the distances against incident light are taken as negative. For example, in figures (a) and (b) the incident light travels from left to right. So, the distances measured in this direction are positive. While in figure (c) the incident light travels from right to left. So, in this case right to left direction will be positive. Distances are measured from pole of the mirror [point P in figure (b)], optical centre of the lens [point C in figure (a)] and the centre of the refracting surface [point M in figure (c)]. It may happen in some problem that sign convention does not remain same for the whole problem. For example, in the Fig. 30.5 shown, the ray of light starting from O first undergoes refraction at A, then reflection at B and then finally refraction at C. For refraction and reflection at A and B the incident light is travelling from left to right, so distances measured along this direction are positive. For final refraction at C the incident light travels from right to left, so now the sign convention will change or right to left is positive. 8. Object distance (from P C , or M along the optic axis) in Fig. 30.4 is shown by u and image distance by v. 9. In front of mirror, object (or image) is always real, lines are always dark and u v ( ) or are always negative. Behind the mirror object (or image) is always virtual, lines are always dotted and u v ( ) or are always positive. This is because light always falls from front side of the mirror. 10. In most of the cases, objects are real (whether refraction or reflection) and ufor them is negative. 24 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics +ve +ve \u2013ve Real Virtual Fig. 30.6 O M A B P C Fig. 30.5 +ve u = \u2013ve O +ve u = \u2013ve O Fig. 30.7  11. In case of mirror light always falls from front of the mirror. But in a lens (or some other refracting surface like slab) light can fall from both sides. 12. Total steps and reduced steps In Fig. 30.9 total steps are five. Four of them are refraction. Only third is reflection. But we have made a lens formula for steps 1 and 2 or 4 and 5. So, the reduced steps are three, lens \u00ae mirror \u00ae lens. 13. Image real or virtual In Fig.30.9, if we wish to find the nature of I 2 (after 2nd refraction), then it is real if it is formed to the right of ABC because ray of light has moved to this side and it is virtual to the left of ABC. Similarly, I 5 is real to the left of ADC and virtual to the right of ADC. 14. Final image coincides with the object In most of these cases there will be one mirror, plane or spherical (convex or concave) and light will be falling normal ( ) \u00d0 = \u00b0 i 0 to this mirror. In case of spherical mirror it is normal if ray of light passes through centre of curvature. In case of normal incidence, ray of light retraces its path and final image coincides with the object. In all above figures, \u00d0 = \u00b0 i 0 (normal incidence). Ray of light retraces its path. 15. Image at infinity means rays after refraction or reflection have become parallel to the optic axis. If a screen is placed directly in between these parallel rays no image will be formed on the screen. But if a lens (or a mirror) is placed on the path of these parallel rays, then image is formed at focus. Sometimes, our eye plays the role of this lens and the image is formed on our retina.

Visual angleq Angle subtended by an object on our eye is called the visual angle. The apparent size depends on the visual angle. As the object moves away from the eye, actual size remains the same but visual angle decreases. Therefore, apparent size decreases. 30.3 Reflection of Light When waves of any type strike the interface between two different materials, new waves are generated which move away from the interface. Experimentally, it is found that the rays corresponding to the incident and reflected waves make equal angles with the normal to the interface and that the reflected ray lies in the plane of incidence formed by the incident ray and the normal. Thus, the two laws of reflection can be summarised as under: (i) \u00d0 = \u00d0 i r (ii) Incident ray, reflected ray and normal lie on the same plane. Two Important Points in Reflection Laws 1. The first law \u00d0 = \u00d0 i r can be applied for any type of surface. The main point is, normal at point of incidence. In spherical surface (convex mirror or concave mirror) normal at any point passes through centre of curvature. 2. Incident ray, reflected ray and normal are sometimes represented in the form of three vectors. Then, these three vectors should be coplanar. 26 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics q1 h < q1 q2 h q2 Fig. 30.12 r i Normal Incident ray Reflected ray Fig. 30.13 C C r i r i Concave mirror Convex mirror Fig. 30.14  Reflection from a Plane Surface (or Plane Mirror) Almost everybody is familiar with the image formed by a plane mirror. If the object is real, the image formed by a plane mirror is virtual, erect, of same size and at the same distance from the mirror. The ray diagram of the image of a point object and of an extended object is as shown below. Important Points in Reflection from Plane Mirror 1. Relation between object distance ( ) u and the image distance ( ) v in case of plane mirror is v u = - Here, v and u are measured from the plane surface. Two conclusions can be drawn from this equation. (i) Negative sign implies that object and image are on opposite sides of the mirror. So, if object is real then image is virtual and vice-versa. (ii) | | | | v u = And this implies that perpendicular distance of the object from the mirror is equal to the perpendicular distance of image from the mirror. 2. Ray Diagram Let us draw the ray diagram of a point object and an extended object. Chapter 30 Reflection of Light \u0097 27 O I A B B\u00a2 A\u00a2 Fig. 30.15 I O Correct = ",

Field of view of an object for a given mirror Suppose a point object O is placed in front of a small mirror as shown in Fig. 30.18 (a), then a question arises in mind whether this mirror will make the image of this object or not. Or suppose an elephant is standing in front of a small mirror, will the mirror form the image of the elephant or not. The answer is yes, it will form. A mirror whatever may be the size of it forms the images of all objects lying in front of it. But every object has its own field of view for the given mirror. The field of view is the region between the extreme reflected rays and depends on the location of the object in front of the mirror. If our eye lies in the field of view then only we can see the image of the object otherwise not. The field of view of an object placed at different locations in front of a plane mirror are shown in Fig. 30.18 (b) and (c). The region between extreme reflected rays (reflected from the end points of the mirror) is called the field of view. To see the image of object eye should lie in this region, as all reflected rays lie in this region. 4. Suppose a mirror is rotated by an angleq (say anti-clockwise), keeping the incident ray fixed then the reflected ray rotates by 2q along the same direction, i.e. anti-clockwise. In figure (a), I is the incident ray, N the normal and R the reflected ray. In figure (b), I remains as it is N and R shift to N \u00a2 and R \u00a2. From the two figures, we can see that earlier the reflected ray makes an angle i with y-axis while after rotating the mirror it makes an angle i \u2013 2q. Thus, we may conclude that the reflected ray has been rotated by an angle 2q. 28 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics O O (b) (c) I O I (a) Fig. 30.18 i i N I R I R\u00a2 q i \u2013 q q i \u2013 q i \u2013 2q N\u00a2 Y X (a) (b) Fig. 30.19  5. The minimum length of a plane mirror to see one\u2019s full height is H 2 , where H is the height of person. But, the mirror should be placed in a fixed position which is shown in Fig. 30.20. A ray starting from head (A) after reflecting from upper end of the mirror (F) reaches the eye at C.

So, apparent size keeps on decreasing. 6. A person is standing exactly at midway between a wall and a mirror and he wants to see the full height of the wall (behind him) in a plane mirror (in front of him).

Object and image velocity There are four important points related to object and image velocity. (i) Image speed is equal to the object speed. (ii) Image velocity and object velocity make same angles from the plane mirror on two opposite sides of the mirror. (iii) Components of velocities which are along the mirror are equal. (iv) Components of velocities which are perpendicular to the mirror are equal and opposite. The following four figures demonstrate the above four points. Three Types of Problems in Reflection from Plane Mirror Type 1. Based on law of reflection \u00d0 = \u00d0 i r Concept These problems are purely based on geometry. Proper normal at point of incidence is very important. V Example 30.1 Two plane mirrors M1 and M2 are inclined at angle q as shown. A ray of light 1, which is parallel to M1 strikes M2 and after two reflections, the ray 2 becomes parallel to M2. Find the angle q. Solution Different angles are as shown in Fig. 30.24.

Terms and Definitions There are two types of spherical mirrors, concave and convex. Centre C of the sphere of which the mirror is a part is called the centre of curvature of the mirror and P the centre of the mirror surface, is called the pole. The line CP produced is the principal axis and AB is the aperture of the mirror. The distance CP is called the radius of curvature (R). All distances are measured from point P. We can see from the two figures that R is positive for convex mirror and negative for concave mirror. Principal  Focus Observation shows that a narrow beam of rays, parallel and near to the principal axis, is reflected from a concave mirror so that all rays converge to a point F on the principal axis. F is called the principal focus of the mirror and it is a real focus, since, light actually passes through it. Concave mirrors are also known as converging mirrors because of their action on a parallel beam of light. They are used in car head-lights, search-lights and telescopes. A narrow beam of rays, parallel and near to the principal axis, falling on a convex mirror is reflected to form a divergent beam which appears to come from a point F behind the mirror. A convex mirror thus has a virtual principal focus. It is also called a diverging mirror. The distance FP is called the focal length (f) of the mirror. Further, we can see that f is negative for a concave mirror and positive for convex mirror. Later, we will see that f R = /2 . 34 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics C Incident light A B (a) Concave mirror C P Incident light A B (b) Convex mirror +ve P Fig. 30.36 C A converging mirror +ve F P F C A diverging mirror P Fig. 30.37  Paraxial rays Rays which are close to the principal axis and make small angles with it, i.e. they are nearly parallel to the axis, are called paraxial rays. Our treatment of spherical mirrors will be restricted to such rays which means we shall consider only mirrors of small aperture. In diagrams, however, they will be made larger for clarity. Images formed by Spherical Mirrors In general position of image and its nature (i.e. whether it is real or virtual, erect or inverted, magnified or diminished) depend on the distance of object from the mirror.

(ii) vI and vO are image and object speeds. (iii) From the above table we can see that image and object always travel in opposite directions as long as they move along the principal axis. Case 2 Convex mirror For real objects there is only one case Chapter 30 Reflection of Light \u0097 35 \u2013\u00b5 C F P +\u00b5 Fig. 30.38 C F P +\u00b5 \u2013\u00b5 Fig. 30.39  Object lies between P and - \u00b5, then image lies between P and F. Image is virtual, erect and diminished. Object speed is greater than the image speed and they travel in opposite directions (along the principal axis). Ray diagrams We shall consider the small objects and mirrors of small aperture so that all rays are paraxial. To construct the image of a point object two of the following four rays are drawn passing through the object. To construct the image of an extended object, the image of two end points is only drawn. The image of a point object lying on principal axis is formed on the principal axis itself. The four rays are as under: Ray 1. A ray through the centre of curvature which strikes the mirror normally and is reflected back along the same path. Ray 2. A ray parallel to principal axis after reflection either actually passes through the principal focus F or appears to diverge from it. Ray 3. A ray passing through the principal focus F or a ray which appears to converge at F is reflected parallel to the principal axis. Ray 4. A ray striking at pole P is reflected symmetrically back in the opposite side. Convex Mirror Image formed by convex mirror is always virtual, erect and diminished, no matter where the object is. Figure shows that convex mirror gives a wider field of view than a plane mirror, convex mirrors are therefore, used as rear view mirrors in cars or scooters. Although, they make the estimation of distances more difficult but still they are preferred because there is only a small movement of the image for a large movement of  the object. 36 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics C F P 3 1 2 4 3 4 2 P F C 1 Fig. 30.40 O I F P Fig. 30.41  Concave Mirror In case of a concave mirror the image is erect and virtual when the object is placed between F and P.

But, always remind that real (and inverted) image is formed only by a concave mirror (for real objects) but virtual image is formed by all three mirrors. The only difference is, in their sizes. Magnified image is obtained from concave mirror, same size from plane mirror and diminished size from convex mirror.

Now, in this type further two cases are possible. Case 1 When object size is very small. In this case image length, L m L I o = 2( ) Here, Lo is the object length. So, using type 1, we have to find v and then m.

Similarly, Du is object length Lo. Case 2 When object size is large. If an extended object is lying along the principal axis, then we will get two values of u corresponding to its two ends. Now, apply mirror formula two times and find two values of v. The image length now becomes, L v v I =| ~ | 1 2 Note If one end of the object is placed either atC or P, then its image will also be formed at C or P. So, we will have to apply the mirror formula only for the other end. 50 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics a\u00a2 c\u00a2 c F b a b\u00a2 a b \u00a2 \u00a2 = 2 mm b c\u00a2 \u00a2 = 4 mm  V Example 10 A small object ab of size 1 mm is kept at a distance of 40 cm from a concave mirror of focal length 30 cm.

V Example 15 A ray of light is incident on a plane mirror along a vector $ $ $ i + j \u2013 k . The normal on incidence point is along $ $ i + j . Find a unit vector along the reflected ray. Solution Reflection of a ray of light is just like an elastic collision of a ball with a horizontal ground. Component of incident ray along the inside normal gets reversed while the component perpendicular to it remains unchanged. Thus, the component of incident ray vector A = $ $ $ i + j \u2013 k parallel to normal, i.e. $ $ i + j gets reversed while perpendicular to it, i.e. \u2013 $k remains unchanged. Thus, the reflected ray can be written as R i j = \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 k $ $ $ \\ A unit vector along the reflected ray will be $ $ $ $ r \u2013 i \u2013 j \u2013 k = = R R 3 or $ \u2013 ($ $ $ ) r i + j + k = 1 3 Ans.

(i) For normal incidence ( ) \u00d0 = i 0 (ii) If refractive index of both media is same, angle of incidence does not matter in this case. Here, m = refractive index of medium Refractive Index (i) In general speed of light in any medium is less than its speed in vacuum. It is convenient to define  refractive index m of a medium as,  m = Speed of light in vacuum Speed of light in medium = c v (ii) As a ray of light travels from medium 1 to medium 2, its wavelength changes but its frequency remains unchanged.  m m l l 2 1 1 2 1 2 > > > , , v v 72 \u0097 Op tics and Mod ern Phys ics 1 2 Fig. 31.1 1 2 m = m 1 2 Fig. 31.2 1 2 l1 l2 Fig. 31.3  (iii) 1 2 2 1 m m m = = Refractive index of 2 w.r.t. 1 and   2 1 1 2 m m m = =   Refractive index of 1 w.r.t. 2  \\ 1 2 2 1 1 m m =                                                                          (iv) 1 2 2 1 m m m = ,  2 3 3 2 m m m =  and  3 1 1 3 m m m = \\          1 2 2 3 3 1 1 m m m \u00b4 \u00b4 = (v) v c = m  and l l m = 0 Here, l is the wavelength in a medium and l 0 the wavelength in vacuum.

What is the in dex of re frac tion of the material? 31.2 Law of Refraction (Snell\u2019s Law) If a ray of light passes through one medium to other medium, then according to Snell\u2019s law,     msin i = constant  \u2026(i) For two media,    m m 1 1 2 2 sin sin i i =     or               m m m 2 1 1 2 1 2 = = sin sin i i \u2026(ii) From Eq. (i) we can see that i i 1 2 >  if m m 2 1 > , i.e. if a ray of light passes from a rarer to a denser medium, it bends towards normal. 74 \u0097 Op tics and Mod ern Phys ics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 31.1 1 2 m1 m2 i1 i2 Fig. 31.4  Eq. (ii) can be written as, 1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2 2 1 m l l m m = = = = sin sin i i v v \u2026(iii) Here, v1 is the speed of light in medium 1 and v2 in medium 2. Similarly, l1 and l 2 are the corresponding wavelengths. If m m 2 1 >  then v v 1 2 >  and l l 1 2 > , i.e. in a rarer medium speed and hence, wavelength of light is more. Experiments show that if the boundaries of the media are parallel, the emergent ray CD although laterally displaced, is parallel to the incident ray AB if m m 1 5 = . We can also directly apply the Snell\u2019s law  (m sin i = constant) in medium 1 and 5, i.e.          m m 1 1 5 5 sin sin i i =       So,                   i i 1 5 =  if m m 1 5 = If any of the boundary is not parallel we cannot use this law directly by jumping the intervening media.

In Fig. 31.8, if we apply the Snell\u2019s law in original form then it is m m air air medium medium sin sin i i = or ( )sin ( )sin 1 i r = m                  \\ m = sin sin i r           \u0098 In  m = sin sin ,i r  angle i is not always the angle of incidence but it is the angle of ray of light in air (with normal). In the above figure, ray of light is travelling from medium to air. So, angle of incidence is actually r. But we have to take i angle in air and now we can apply m = sin sin i r. \u0098 In m = sin sin i r, if i is changed, then r angle also changes. But sin sin i r remains constant and this constant is called refractive index of that medium. \u0098 m = sin sin i r can be applied for any pair of angles i and r except the normal incidence for which \u00d0 = \u00d0 = \u00b0 i r 0 and  m = sin sin i r is an indeterminant form.

This implies that object and image lie on same side of the plane surface. If one is real, then the other is virtual.  (iii) If ray of light travels from denser medium to rarer medium ( ) or m m 1 2 > , then we can see that  v u < ) or the image distance is less than the object distance. If the light travels from rarer to denser  medium ( ) m m 1 2 < , then v u >  or the image distance is greater than the object distance. Further, if rarer medium is air (or vacuum), then this decrease or increase in image distance will be m times. (iv) In all the four figures, single refraction is taking place through a plane surface. Refractive index of medium (may be glass, water etc.) is m. In figures (a) and (d), the ray of light is travelling from denser to rarer medium and hence, it bends away from the normal. In figures (b) and (c), the ray of light is travelling from a rarer to a denser medium and hence, it bends towards the normal. Now, let us take the four figures individually.

Note If ray of light falls normal to a mirror, then there is no need of applying the slab formula in return journey of ray of light.

(ii) If the ray of light is travelling from first medium to second medium, then for image distance v, we  have the formula m m m m 2 1 2 1 v u R - = - (iii) For plane surface R = \u00b5.

(iv) Ray of light has moved in medium-2, so image formed in medium-2 will be real and v in this medium will be positive. Proof  Consider two transparent media having indices of refraction m1 and m 2, where the boundary between the two media is a spherical surface of radius R. We assume that m m 1 2 < . Let us consider a single ray leaving point O and focusing at point I. Snell\u2019s law applied to this refracted ray gives, m q m q 1 1 2 2 sin sin = Because q1 and q 2 are assumed to be small, we can use  the small angle approximation                                sinq q \u00bb          (angles in radians) and say that           m q m q 1 1 2 2 =        \u2026(i) From the geometry shown in the figure, q a b 1 = +                     \u2026(ii) and      b q g = + 2      \u2026(iii) The above three equations can be rearranged as,  b m m a b g = + + 1 2 ( ) So, m a m g m m b 1 2 2 1 + = ( \u2013 )       \u2026(iv) 86 \u0097 Op tics and Mod ern Phys ics 1 2 R = \u2013 ve u = \u2013 ve 1 2 R = +ve  +ve u = \u2013ve O Fig. 31.29 O M m1 m2 C I d b q2 g q1 P +ve u v R a Fig. 31.30  Since, the arc PM (of length s) subtends an angle b at the centre of curvature, b = s R Also in the paraxial approximation, a = s u  and g = s v Using these expressions in Eq.

We call this a thin lens. Lenses are of two basic types convex (converging) which are thicker in the middle than at the edges and concave (diverging) for which the reverse holds. 88 \u0097 Op tics and Mod ern Phys ics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 31.5 Biconvex Plano-convex Convex meniscus Biconcave Plano-concave Concave meniscus Fig. 31.33 Types of lens.  Figure shows examples of both types bounded by spherical or plane surfaces. As there are two spherical surfaces, there are two centres of curvature C1 and C2 correspondingly two radii of curvature R1 and R2. The line joining C1 and C2 is called the principal axis of the lens. The centre P of the thin lens which lies on the principal axis, is called the optical centre. (ii) All lens formulae (which we will use in this chapter) can be applied directly under following two conditions. Condition 1 Lens should be thin or its thickness should be negligible. Condition 2 On both sides of the lens, medium should be same (not necessarily air) (iii) If either of the above two conditions are not satisfied, then apply refraction formulae m m m m 2 1 2 1 v u R - = - \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 for spherical surface or v u = m m 2 1 for plane surface) two times.

Important points in formulae (i) On linear magnification m From the value of m, we can determine nature of image, type of lens and an approximate position of object. Following  table illustrates this point. Table 31.2 Value of m Nature of image Type of lens Object position - 3 Inverted, real and magnified convex Between F1 and 2 1F -1 Inverted, real and same size convex at 2 1F - 1 2 Inverted, real and diminished convex Between 2 1F and - \u00a5 + 2 Erect, virtual and magnified convex Between O and F1 + 1 4 Erect, virtual and diminished concave Between O and - \u00a5 Note For real objects, real image is formed only by convex lens.

(ii) comes out a positive quantity and if the lens is placed in air, ( \u2013 ) m 1 is also a positive quantity. Hence, the focal length f of a converging lens turns out to be positive. For a diverging lens however, R1 is negative and R2 is positive and the focal length f becomes negative.

(i)] depends on m m 1 2 1 , , R and R2. Thus, if a lens and a mirror are immersed in some liquid, the focal length of lens would change while that of the mirror will remain unchanged. Suppose m m 2 1 < in Eq. (i), i.e. refractive index of the medium (in which lens is placed) is more than the refractive index of the material of the lens, then m m 2 1 1 \u2013 \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7becomes a negative quantity, i.e. the lens changes its behaviour. A converging lens behaves as a diverging lens and vice-versa. An air bubble in water seems as a convex lens but behaves as a concave (diverging) lens. (iii) Power of lens By optical power of an instrument (whether it is a lens, mirror or a refractive surface) we mean the ability of the instrument to deviate the path of rays passing through it. If the instrument converges the rays parallel to the principal axis its power is said to be positive and if it diverges the rays it is said a negative power. 96 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Fig. 31.49 Air bubble in water diverges the parallel beam of light incident on it. f1 f2 Fig. 31.50 ",

(iv) Based on two or more than two thin lenses in contact (or at some distance) If the lenses are kept in contact, then after finding the equivalent focal length F from the equation 1 1 1 1 2 F f f = + We can directly apply the formula 1 1 1 v u F - = Chapter 31 Refraction of Light \u0097 97  for finding the image distance v, but we will have to apply lens formula, 1 1 1 v u f - = two times if the lenses are kept at some distance. Proofs of Different Formulae (i) Consider an object O placed at a distance u from a convex lens as shown in figure. Let its image I after two refractions from spherical surfaces of radii R1 (positive) and R2 (negative) be formed at a distance v from the lens. Let v1 be the distance of image formed by refraction from the refracting surface of radius R1. This image acts as an object for the second surface. Using, m m m m 2 1 2 1 v u R \u2013 \u2013 = We have, m m m m 2 1 1 2 1 1 v u R \u2013 \u2013 = \u2026(i) and m m m m 1 2 1 1 2 2 v v R \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 = \u2026(ii) Adding Eqs. (i) and (ii) and then simplifying, we get 1 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 v u R R \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 = \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 m m \u2026(iii) This expression relates the image distance v of the image formed by a thin lens to the object distance u and to the thin lens properties (index of refraction and radii of curvature). It is valid only for paraxial rays and only when the lens thickness is much less than R1 and R2. The focal length f of a thin lens is the image distance that corresponds to an object at infinity. So, putting u = \u00a5 and v f = in the above equation, we have 1 1 1 1 2 1 1 2 f R R = \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 m m \u2013 \u2013 \u2026(iv) If the refractive index of the material of the lens is m and it is placed in air, m m 2 = and m1 1 = so that Eq. (iv) becomes 1 1 1 1 1 2 f R R = \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 m \u2026(v) This is called the lens maker\u2019s formula because it can be used to determine the values of R1 and R2 that are needed for a given refractive index and a desired focal length f. 98 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics O ",

Focal length of the lens is 10 cm. Solution Convex lens forms both types of images real as well as virtual. Since, nature of the image is not mentioned in the question, we will have to consider both the cases. When image is real Means v is positive and u is negative with | | | | v u = 2 . Thus, if u x = \u2013 , then v x = 2 and f =10cm Substituting in 1 1 1 v u f \u2013 = We have 1 2 1 1 10 x x + = or 3 2 1 10 x = \\ x =15cm Ans. x =15cm, means object lies between F and 2 F.

Solution Substituting sign of f in the lens formula, we have 1 1 1 v u f - = - or 1 1 1 v u f = - K (i) 104 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  For real image v should be positive. Therefore, from Eq. (i) we can see that u should be positive and less than f. Further, u is positive and less than f means a virtual object should lie between O and F1. Important Result Under normal conditions, a convex lens makes a real image. But the image is virtual (and magnified) if a real object is placed between O and F1. Opposite is the case with concave lens. Under normal conditions it makes a virtual image (for all real objects). But the image is real if a virtual object is placed between O and F1. Type 6.

Displacement method of finding focal length of a convex lens If the distance d between an object and screen is greater than 4 times the focal length of a convex lens, then there are two Chapter 31 Refraction of Light \u0097 115 R O 20 cm Air m = 1.5 R = 40 cm Fig. 31.83  positions of the lens between the object and the screen at which a sharp image of the object is formed on the screen. This method is called displacement method and is used in laboratory to determine the focal length of convex lens. To prove this, let us take an object placed at a distance u from a convex lens of focal length f. The distance of image from the lens v d u = ( \u2013 ). From the lens formula, 1 1 1 v u f \u2013 = We have, 1 1 1 d u u f \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 = or u du df 2 0 \u2013 + = \\ u d d d f = \u00b1 ( \u2013 ) 4 2 Now, there are following possibilities: (i) If d f < 4 , then u is imaginary. So, physically no position of the lens is possible. (ii) If d f = 4 , then u d f = = 2 2 . So, only one position is possible. From here we can see that the minimum distance between an object and its real image in case of a convex lens is 4 f. (iii) If d f > 4 , there are two positions of lens at distances d d d f + ( \u2013 ) 4 2 and d d d f \u2013 ( \u2013 ) 4 2 for which real image is formed on the screen.

(ii) If a ray of light is travelling from a denser to a rarer medium with angle of incidence greater than a critical angle ( ) i C > q , then no refraction takes place but ray of light is 100% reflected in the same medium.

(ii) Optical fibres Light can be confined within a bent glass rod by TIR and so \u2018piped\u2019 along a twisted path as in figure. The beam is reflected from side to side practically without loss (except for that due to absorption in the glass) and emerges only at the end of the rod where it strikes the surface almost normally, i.e. at an angle less than the critical angle. A single, very thin, solid glass fibre behaves in the same way and if several thousands are taped together a flexible light pipe is obtained that can be used, for example in medicine and engineering to illuminate an inaccessible spot.

Thus, the condition of no emergence is ( ) min r C 2 > q or A C C \u2013 q q > or A C > 2q \u2026(xii) (vi) Dispersion and deviation of light by a prism White light is a superposition of waves with wavelengths extending throughout the visible spectrum. The speed of light in vacuum is the same for all wavelengths, but the speed in a material substance is different for different wavelengths. Therefore, the index of refraction of a material depends on wavelength. In most materials, the value of refractive index m decreases with increasing wavelength. If a beam of white light, which contains all colours, is sent through the prism, it is separated into a spectrum of colours. The spreading of light into its colour components is called dispersion. Dispersive Power When a beam of white light is passed through a prism of transparent material, light of different wavelengths are deviated by different amounts. Ifd r ,d y andd v are the deviations for red, yellow and violet components then average deviation is measured by d y as yellow light falls in between red and violet. d d v r \u2013 is called angular dispersion. The dispersive power of a material is defined as the ratio of angular dispersion to the average deviation when a white beam of light is passed through it. It is denoted by w. As we know d m = ( \u2013 )1 A This equation is valid when A and i are small. Suppose, a beam of white light is passed through such a prism, the deviation of red, yellow and violet light are d m r r A = ( \u2013 )1 , d m y y A = ( \u2013 )1 and d m v v A = ( \u2013 )1 Chapter 31 Refraction of Light \u0097 129 A B C White light Red (660 nm) Violet (410 nm) Fig. 31.105 Violet Yellow Red dr dy dv Fig. 31.106  The angular dispersion is d d m m v r v r A \u2013 ( \u2013 ) = and the average deviation isd m y y A = ( \u2013 )1 . Thus, the dispersive power of the medium is w m m m = v r y \u2013 \u20131 \u2026(i) Dispersion without Average Deviation and Average Deviation without Dispersion Figure shows two prisms of refracting angles A and A\u00a2 and dispersive powerswandw\u00a2 respectively. They are placed in contact in such a way that the two refracting angles are reversed with respect to each other. A ray of light passes through the combination as shown. The deviations produced by the two prisms are d m 1 1 = ( \u2013 ) A and d m 2 1 = \u00a2 \u00a2 ( \u2013 ) A As the two deviations are opposite to each other, the net deviation is d d d m m = = \u00a2 \u00a2 1 2 1 1 \u2013 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ( \u2013 ) A A \u2026(ii) Using this equation, the average deviation produced by the combination if white light is passed is d m m y y y A A = \u00a2 \u00a2 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ( \u2013 ) 1 1 \u2026(iii) and the net angular dispersion is d d m m m m v r v r v r A A \u2013 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ( \u2013 ) = \u00a2 \u00a2 \u00a2 But, as m m w m v r y \u2013 ( \u2013 ) = 1 from Eq. (i), we have d d m w m w v r y y A A \u2013 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ( \u2013 ) = \u00a2 \u00a2 \u00a2 1 1 \u2026(iv) Dispersion without average deviation From Eq. (iii), d y = 0 if A A y y \u00a2 = \u00a2 m m \u2013 \u2013 1 1 \u2026(v) This is the required condition of dispersion without average deviation. Using this in Eq. (iv), the net angular dispersion produced is d d m w w v r y A \u2013 ( \u2013 ) ( \u2013 ) = \u00a2 1 Average deviation without dispersion From Eq. (iv), d d v r \u2013 = 0 if A A y y v r v r \u00a2 = \u00a2 \u00a2 = \u00a2 \u00a2 ( \u2013 ) ( \u2013 ) \u2013 \u2013 m w m w m m m m 1 1 \u2026(vi) This is the required condition of average deviation without dispersion. Using the above condition in Eq. (iii), the net average deviation is d m w w y y A = \u00a2 \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 1 1 130 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics A A\u00a2 w w\u00a2 d1 d2 Fig. 31.107  Important Points in Prism 1. Equation r r A 1 2 + = can be applied at any of the three vertices. For example in the figure shown, r r B 1 2 + = . 2. Sometimes a part of a prism is given as shown in Fig. 31.109 (a). To solve such problems, first complete the prism then solve as the problems of prism are solved. 3. For isosceles or equilateral triangle ( ) \u00d0 = \u00d0 B C , ray of light is parallel to base of the prism at minimum deviation condition. Under minimum deviation condition, we know that r r 1 2 = \u00de a b = . Because, a = \u00b0 + 90 1r and b = \u00b0 + 90 2r . Further, it is given that \u00d0 = \u00d0 B C. Therefore, MN is parallel to BC. 4. In some cases, when deviation at M is clockwise and deviation at N is anti-clockwise, then r r A 1 2 - = Chapter 31 Refraction of Light \u0097 131 A B r1 r2 C Fig. 31.108 A B C a r1 M N b r2 Fig. 31.110 A B C (b) (a) 60\u00b0 70\u00b0 60\u00b0 50\u00b0 70\u00b0 \u00de Fig. 31.109 M r1r2 N B C A Fig. 31.111  This condition is normally obtained with thin angle prisms as shown above: At M, deviation is clockwise and at N deviation is anti-clockwise.

Different identical equilateral triangles are arranged as shown in Fig. 31.113. Deviation by prism(s) in each case will be same, if angle of incidence is same. Examples of Prism V Example 31.35 One face of a prism with a refractive angle of 30\u00b0 is coated with silver. A ray of light incident on another face at an angle of 45\u00b0 is refracted and reflected from the silver coated face and retraces its path. What is the refractive index of the prism? Solution Given, A = \u00b0 30 , i1 45 = \u00b0 and r2 0 = Since, r r A 1 2 + = \\ r A 1 30 = = \u00b0 Now, refractive index of the prism, m = = \u00b0 \u00b0 = = sin sin sin sin i r 1 1 45 30 1 2 1 2 2 Ans. 132 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics A B C Fig. 31.112 Fig. 31.113 45\u00b0 90\u00b0 Fig. 31.114  V Example 31.36 In the shown figure, mirror is rotated by an angle q. Find q if (a) ray of light retraces its path after reflection from M (b) ray of light MP turns in the direction of MN. Solution In this case, A and i1 are small. Therefore, deviation by prism can be obtained by d m = - = - \u00b0 = \u00b0 ( ) ( )( ) 1 1 2 1 A 1.5 Hence, the prism will deviate the ray of light by 1\u00b0 from its original path as shown in Fig. 31.116. (a) In the absence of prism, ray of light was falling normal to the mirror. So, ray of light was already retracing its path. Prism has rotated the ray by 1\u00b0 in clockwise direction. So if we rotate the mirror also by 1\u00b0 in clockwise direction, then ray of light will further fall normal to the mirror and it again retraces its path. Therefore, the correct answer is q = \u00b01 ,clockwise Ans. (b) If we rotate a plane mirror by q in clockwise direction, then reflected ray also rotates in clockwise direction by an angle 2q. Here, we have to rotate reflected ray MP by 1\u00b0 in clockwise direction to make it in the direction of MN. Therefore, we will have to rotate the mirror by 0.5\u00b0 in clockwise direction. Therefore, the correct answer is q = \u00b0 0.5 clockwise , Ans. V Example 31.37 General method of finding deviation by prism. In the ray diagram shown in figure, find total deviation by prism.

(i) Applying Snell\u2019s law at point M, we have m = sin sin i r 1 1 or 2 45 1 = \u00b0 sin sin r Solving this equation, we get r1 30 = \u00b0 (ii) r r A 1 2 + = \\ 30 75 2 \u00b0 + = \u00b0 r \\ r2 45 = \u00b0 (iii) Further applying Snell\u2019s law at N, m = sin sin i r 2 2 \u00de 2 45 2 = \u00b0 sin sin i Solving this equation, we get i2 90 = \u00b0 Now, substituting the values in Eq.

Show that the emergent ray is perpendicular to the face through which it emerges and calculate the refractive index of the material of prism. 6.

In refraction Deviation in refraction is given by d = - i r (where, i r > ) Note (i) To plot d versus i graph, first we will have to convert r into i with the help of Snell\u2019s law, otherwise there are three variables in the equation, d = - i r (ii) In general, deviation in reflection is more than the deviation in refraction. 136 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics d i i Fig. 31.123 i = 0\u00b0 90\u00b0 i = 90\u00b0 Fig. 31.124 d i 180\u00b0 O\u00b0 90\u00b0 Fig. 31.125 Fig. 31.126 i d r Fig. 31.127  4.

Our eye lens has a power to adjust its focal length to see the nearer objects. This process of adjusting focal length is called accommodation. However, if the object is brought too close to the eye, the focal length cannot be adjusted to form the image on the retina. Thus, there is a minimum distance for the clear vision of an object. This distance is called least distance of distinct vision (+D). For normal eye this distance is generally taken to be 25 cm. Visual angle The size of an object as sensed by us is related to the size of the image formed on the retina. The size of the image on the retina is roughly proportional to the angle subtended by the object on the eye. This angle is known as the visual angle. Optical instruments are used to increase this angle artificially in order to improve the clarity. Magnifying power ( ) M Magnifying power is the factor by which the image on the retina can be enlarged by using the microscope or telescope. For a microscope and for a telescope the definition of M is slightly different. For a microscope, M = Visual angle formed by final image Visual angle formed by the object when kept at distance D 138 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics i = 0\u00b0 d = 0\u00b0 45\u00b0 d = 45\u00b0 Fig. 31.130 q h Image q Fig. 31.132 d 90\u00b0 45\u00b0 0\u00b0 45\u00b0 90\u00b0 i Ref ra c ti o n Reflection Fig. 31.131  For a telescope, M = Visual angle formed by final image Visual angle subtended by the object directly when seen from naked eye Note that M is different from linear magnification m v u = \u00b1 \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7which is the ratio of height of image to that of object while M is the ratio of apparent increase in size of image seen by the eye. Unit of M is X, thus we write an angular magnification of 10 as 10X . Simple microscope To view an object with naked eyes, the object must be placed between D and infinity. The maximum angle is subtended when it is placed at D. Say this angle is q o . Then, qo h D = This angle can be further increased if a converging lens of short focal length is placed just in front of the eye. The lens used for this purpose is called simple microscope or a magnifier. The object is placed at a distance uo from the lens (between pole and focus of lens). The virtual magnified image is formed as shown. This image subtends a visual angle say q on the eye. Then, q = h uo From the definition of magnifying power for a microscope, M h u h D o o = = q q / / \\ M D uo = For relaxed eye The final image should be at infinity. Thus, u f o = \\ M D f \u00a5 = This is also called magnifying power for normal adjustment. We can see that M \u00a5 >1if f D < . Chapter 31 Refraction of Light \u0097 139 q h uo Fig. 31.134 qo h D Fig. 31.133  Magnifying power when final image is at D In the above case, we saw that M is equal D f . The magnification can be made large by choosing the focal length f small. The magnifying power can be increased in an another way by moving the object still closer to the lens. Suppose, the final virtual image is formed at a distance D. Then, from the equation 1 1 1 v u f \u2013 = , we have 1 1 1 \u2013D u f o + = or 1 1 1 u D f o = + Substituting this value in the equation, M D uo = , we have M D f D = + 1 Note (i) That M M D > \u00a5, i.e. when final image is formed at 25 cm, angular magnification is increased but eye is most strained. On the other hand when final image is at infinity, angular magnification is slightly less but eye is relaxed. So, the choice is yours whether you want to see bigger size with strained eye or smaller size with relaxed eye. (ii) That M can be increased by decreasing f, but due to several other aberrations the image becomes too defective at large magnification with a simple microscope. Roughly speaking a magnification upto 4 is trouble free. Compound Microscope Figure shows a simplified version of a compound microscope. It consists of two converging lenses arranged coaxially. The one facing the object is called objective and the one close to eye is called eyepiece. The objective has a smaller aperture and smaller focal length than those of the eyepiece. The separation between the objective and the eyepiece (called the length of the microscope L) can be varied by appropriate screws fixed on the panel of microscope. The object is placed beyond first focus of objective, so that an inverted and real image (intermediate image) is formed by the objective. This intermediate image acts as an object for the eyepiece and lies 140 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics q h uo h' Objective Image Eyepiece fo vo ue F Fig. 31.135  between first focus and pole of eye piece. The final magnified virtual image is formed by the eyepiece. Let q be the angle subtended by the final image on the eye, then, q = \u00a2h ue Here, h\u00a2 is the height of the first image and ue is its distance from the eyepiece.

To look at distant objects such as a star, a planet or a distant tree etc., we use telescopes. There are three types of telescopes in use. (i) Astronomical telescope, (ii) Terrestrial telescope and (iii) Galilean telescope. (i) Astronomical telescope Figure shows the construction and working of an astronomical telescope. It consists of two converging lenses placed coaxially. The one facing the distant object is called the objective and has a large aperture and large focal length. The other is called the eyepiece, as the eye is placed closed to it. The eyepiece tube can slide within the objective tube, so that the separation between the objective and the eyepiece may be varied. Magnifying power Although a telescope can also be used to view the objects of few kilometers away but the magnifying power calculated below is for the case when object is at infinity. Rays coming from the object in that case will be almost parallel. The image formed by objective will be at its second focus. This image called the intermediate image will act as the object for eyepiece. This usually lies between pole and first focus of eyepiece. So that eyepiece forms a virtual and magnified image of it. | | a = angle subtended by object on objective (or you can say at eye) = \u00a2 \u00a2 ",

It depends on the wavelengthl of the light, the refractive index m of the medium between the object and the objective and the angle q subtended by a radius of the objective on one of the objects. R d = = 1 2 D m q l sin To increase R, objective and object are immersed in oil. Telescope The resolving power of a telescope is defined as the reciprocal of the angular separation between two distant objects which are just resolved by a telescope. It is given by R a = = 1 Dq l 1.22 Here, a is the diameter of the objective. That is why, telescopes with larger objective aperture are used. V Example 31.40 An astronomical telescope has an angular magnification of magnitude 5 for distant objects. The separation between the objective and eyepiece is 36 cm and the final image is formed at infinity. Determine the focal length of objective and eyepiece. Chapter 31 Refraction of Light \u0097 145  Solution For final image at infinity, M f f o e \u00a5 = and L f f o e \u00a5 = + \\ 5 = f f o e \u2026(i) and 36 = + f f o e \u2026(ii) Solving these two equations, we have fo = 30 cm and fe = 6 cm Ans. V Example 31.41 A telescope has an objective of focal length 50 cm and an eyepiece of focal length 5 cm. The least distance of distinct vision is 25 cm. The telescope is focused for distinct vision on a scale 2 m away from the objective. Calculate (a) magnification produced and (b) separation between objective and eyepiece. Solution Given, fo = 50 cm and fe = 5 cm Note Here, object is placed at finite distance from the objective. Hence, formulae derived for angular magnification M cannot be applied directly as they have been derived for the object to be at infinity. Here, it will be difficult to find angular magnification. So, only linear magnification can be obtained.

In figure, P is a point in air and Q a point in a medium of refractive index m. In air, speed of light is c and in the medium speed of light is v c = m. Suppose that, the ray of light follows a path PSQ where S is at a distance x from M. Then, time taken by the ray of light in reaching from P to Q is t ",

Eye is most sensitive to yellow-green light ( ) l = 5550 \u00c5 . 5. Frequency of visible light is of the order of1015 Hz. 6. Colour of light is determined by its frequency and not the wavelength. During refraction of light frequency and colour of light do not change. 7. Twinkling of stars Due to fluctuations in refractive index of atmosphere the refraction of light (reaching to our eye from the star) becomes irregular and the light sometimes reaches the eye and sometimes it does not. This gives rise to twinkling of stars. 8. Oval shape of sun in the morning and evening In the morning or evening, the sun is at the horizon. The refractive index decreases with height. Light reaching earth\u2019s atmosphere from different parts of vertical diameter of the sun enters at different heights in earth\u2019s atmosphere and so travels in media of different refractive indices at the same instant and hence, bends unequally. Due to this unequal bending of light from vertical diameter, the image of the sun gets distorted and it appears oval and larger. However, at noon when the sun is overhead, then due to normal incidence there will be no bending and the sun will appear circular. 9. The sparkling of diamond is due to total internal reflection inside it. 10. Mirage Mirage in deserts is caused by total internal reflection. 148 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Earth Denser (A) Mirage Rarer O I i > qC  Due to heating of the earth, the refractive index of air near the surface of earth becomes lesser than above it. Light from distant objects reaches the surface of earth with i C > q . So that total internal reflection will take place and we see the image of an object along with the object as seen in figure, creating an illusion of water near the object. 11. Duration of sun\u2019s visibility In the absence of atmosphere, the sun will be visible for its positions from M to E as shown in figure. However, in presence of atmosphere, due to total internal reflection, the sun will become visible even when it is below the horizon. 12. Looming It is also due to total internal reflection. This phenomenon is observed in cold deserts and is opposite to that of mirage. 13. Scattering of light If the molecules of a medium after absorbing incoming radiations (light) emit them in all possible directions, the process is called scattering. In scattering if the wavelength of radiation remains unchanged the scattering is called elastic otherwise inelastic. Rayleigh has shown, theoretically that in case of elastic scattering of light by molecules, the intensity of scattered light depends on both nature of molecules and wavelength of light. According to him, Intensity of scattered light \u00b5 1 4 l Raman effect was based on inelastic scattering. For this C.V. Raman was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1930. Scattering helps us in understanding the following: Why sky is Blue When white light from the sun enters the earth\u2019s atmosphere, scattering takes place. As scattering is proportional to 1 4 l , blue is scattered most. When we look at the sky we receive scattered light which is rich in blue and hence, the sky appears blue. Why sun appears red during sunset and sunrise In the morning and evening when sun is at the horizon, due to oblique incidence, light reaches earth after traversing maximum path in the atmosphere and so suffers maximum scattering. Now, as scattering \u00b5 1 4 l , shorter wavelengths are scattered most leaving the longer one. As red light has longest wavelength in the visible region, it is scattered least. This is why sun appears red in the morning and evening. The same reason is why red light is used for danger signals. 14. Defects of images Actual image formed by an optical system is usually imperfect. The defects of images are called aberrations. The defect may be due to light or optical system. If the defect is due to light, it is called chromatic aberration, and if due to optical system, monochromatic aberration. Chapter 31 Refraction of Light \u0097 149 Sky Rarer Denser Earth Looming I O i > qC O Earth Horizon E M (Evening) (Morning)  (a) Chromatic aberration The image of an object formed by a lens is usually coloured and blurred. This defect of image is called chromatic aberration. This defect arises due to the fact that focal length of a lens is different for different colours. For a lens, 1 1 1 1 1 2 f R R = \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 ( \u2013 ) \u2013 m As m is maximum for violet while minimum for red, violet is focused nearest to the lens while red farthest from it. The difference between fR and fV is a measure of longitudinal chromatic aberration. Thus, LCA = f f R V \u2013 Condition of achromatism To get achromatism, we use a pair of two lenses in contact. For two thin lenses in contact we have, \\ w w 1 1 2 2 0 f f + = This is the condition of achromatism. From the condition of achromatism, following conclusions can be drawn: (i) As w1 and w2 are positive quantities, f1 and f2 should have opposite signs, i.e. if one lens is convex, the other must be concave. (ii) If w w 1 2 = , means both the lenses are of same material. Then, 1 1 0 1 2 f f + = or 1 0 F = or F = \u00a5 Thus, the combination behaves as a plane glass plate. So, we can conclude that both the lenses should be of different materials or w w 1 2 \u00b9 (iii) Dispersive power of crown glass ( ) wC is less than that of flint glass ( ) wF . (iv) If we want the combination to behave as a convergent lens, then convex lens should have lesser focal length or its dispersive power should be more. Thus, convex lens should be made of flint glass and concave lens of crown. Thus, combination is converging if convex is made of flint glass and concave of crown. Similarly, for the combination to behave as diverging lens, convex is made of crown glass and concave of flint glass. (b) Monochromatic aberration This is the defect in image due to optical system. Monochromatic aberration is of many types such as, spherical, coma, distortion, curvature and astigmatism. Here, we shall limit ourselves to spherical aberration only. Spherical aberration Spherical aberration arises due to spherical nature of lens (or mirror). 150 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics fV fR White Red Violet ",

The inability of the lens to form a point image of an axial point object is called spherical aberration. Spherical aberration can never be eliminated but can be minimised by the following methods: (i) By using stops By using stops either paraxial or marginal rays are cut-off. (ii) Using two thin lenses separated by a distance Two thin lenses separated by a distance d f f = 2 1 \u2013 has the minimum spherical aberration. (iii) Using parabolic mirrors If spherical mirror is replaced by parabolic mirror, spherical aberration is minimised. . (iv) Using lens of large focal length It has been found that spherical aberration varies inversely as the cube of the focal length. So, if f is large, spherical aberration will be reduced. (v) Using plano-convex lens In case of plano-convex lens, spherical aberration is minimised, if its curved surface faces the incident or emergent ray whichever is more parallel. This is why in telescope, the curved surface faces the object while in microscope curved surface is towards the image.

(b) The persistance of vision is 1 10 sec, i.e. if time interval between two consecutive light pulses is less than 0.1 sec, eye cannot distinguish them separately.

Now, the two waves from S1 and S 2 meet at some point (say P). Then, according to principle of superposition net displacement at P (from its mean position) at any time is given by y y y = + 1 2 Here, y1 and y2 are the displacements of P due to two waves individually. For example, suppose at 9 AM, displacement of P above its mean position should be 6 mm accordingly to wave-1 and at the same time its displacement should be2 mm below its mean position accordingly to wave-2, then at 9 AM net displacement of P will be 4mm above its mean position. Now, based upon the principle of superposition we have two phenomena in physics, interference and beats. Stationary waves (or standing waves) and Young's double slit experiment (or YDSE) are two examples of interference. Based on principle of superposition means two or more than two waves meet at one point or several points and at every point net displacement is y y y = + 1 2 or y y y y = + + 1 2 3 etc. 32.2 Resultant Amplitude and Intensity due to Coherent Sources In article 32.1, we have seen that the two waves from two sources S1 and S 2 were meeting at point P. Suppose they meet at P in a phase difference Df (orf). If this phase difference remains constant with time, then sources are called coherent, otherwise incoherent. For sources to be coherent, the frequencies (f , wor T) of the two sources must be same. This can be understood by the following example. Suppose the phase difference is 0\u00b0. It means they are in same phase. Both reaches their extremes (+ A or - A) simultaneously. They cross their mean positions (in the same direction) simultaneously. Now, if we want their phase difference to remain constant or we want that the above situation is maintained all the time, then obviously their time periods (or frequencies) must be same. Resultant Amplitude 1. Consider the superposition of two sinusoidal waves of same frequency (means sources are coherent) at some point. Let us assume that the two waves are travelling in the same direction with same velocity. The equation of the two waves reaching at a point can be written as y A kx t 1 1 = sin ( \u2013 ) w and y A kx t 2 2 = + f sin ( \u2013 ) w 192 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics ",

If the phase difference between two sources does not remain constant, then the places of maxima and minima shift. In case of mechanical waves it is possible to keep a constant phase relationship between two different sources. But in case of light two different light sources can\u2019t be coherent This is because of the way light is emitted. In ordinary light sources, atoms gain excess energy by thermal agitation or by impact with accelerated electrons. An atom that is \u2018excited\u2019 in such a way begins to radiate energy and continues until it has lost all the energy it can, typically in a time of the order of 10 8 \u2013 s. Chapter 32 Interference and Diffraction of Light \u0097 195 Extra Points to Remember  The many atoms in a source ordinarily radiate in an unsynchronized and random phase relationship, and the light that is emitted from two such sources has no definite phase relationship. Hence, to obtain a stable interference in light a single source is split into two coherent sources. Following are shown some of the methods by which we can split a single light source into two. V Example 32.1 In interference, two individual amplitudes are A0 each and the intensity is I0 each. Find resultant amplitude and intensity at a point, where: (a) phase difference between two waves is 60\u00b0 (b) path difference between two waves is l 3 . Solution (a) Substituting f= \u00b0 60 in the equations, A A =2 2 0 cos f and I I =4 2 0 2 cos f We get, A A = 3 0 and I I =3 0 Ans. (b) Given, Dx = l 3 \\ for D D f p l =\u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00d7 2 x =\u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7= 2 3 2 3 p l l p or 120\u00b0 Now, substituting f= \u00b0 120 in the above two equations, we get A A = 0 and I I = 0 Ans. V Example 32.2 Three waves from three coherent sources meet at some point. Resultant amplitude of each is A0. Intensity corresponding to A0 is I0. Phase difference between first wave and the second wave is 60\u00b0. Path difference between first wave and the third wave is l 3 . The first wave lags behind in phase angle from second and the third wave. Find resultant intensity at this point. Solution Here, the sources are three. So, we don't have any direct formula for finding the resultant intensity. First we will find the resultant amplitude by vector method and then, by the relation I A \u00b5 2, we can also find the resulting intensity. Further, a path difference of l 3 is equivalent to a phase difference of 120\u00b0 (Df or f p l = \u00d7 2 Dx). 196 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics ",

Now, resultant of first and third acting at 120\u00b0 is also A0 (as A A =2 2 0 cos f and f= \u00b0 120 ) and since the first and third are equal, so this resultant A0 passes through the bisector line of these two or in the direction of second amplitude vector.

This behaviour indicates that light, once it has passed through the aperture, spreads beyond the narrow path defined by the aperture into regions that would be in shadow if light travelled in straight lines. Other waves, such as sound waves and water waves, also have this property Chapter 32 Interference and Diffraction of Light \u0097 209 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 32.2  of spreading when passing through apertures or by sharp edges. This phenomenon, known as diffraction, can be described only with a wave model for light. In general, diffraction occurs when waves pass through small openings, around obstacles, or past sharp edges. As shown in figure, when an opaque object is placed between a point source of light and a screen, no sharp boundary exists on the screen between a shadowed region and an illuminated region. The illuminated region above the shadow of the object contains alternating light and dark fringes. Such a display is called a diffraction pattern. In this chapter, we restrict our attention to Fraunhofer diffraction, which occurs, for example, when all the rays passing through a narrow slit are approximately parallel to one another. This can be 210 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics (a) (b) Fig. 32.16 (a) If light waves did not spread out after passing through the slits, no interference would occur (b) The light waves from the two slits overlap as they spread out, filling what we expect to be shadowed regions with light and producing interference fringes. Source Opaque object Viewing screen Fig. 32.17 Light from a small source passes by the edge of an opaque object. We might expect no light to appear on the screen below the position of the edge of the object. In reality, light bends around the top edge of the object and enter this region. Because of these effects, a diffraction pattern consisting of bright and dark fringes appears in the region above the edge of the object.  achieved experimentally either by placing the screen far from the opening used to create the diffraction or by using a converging lens to focus the rays once they pass through the opening, as shown in Fig. 32.18. 32.6 Diffraction from a Narrow Slit Until now, we have assumed that slits are point sources of light. In this section, we abandon that assumption and see how the finite width of slits is the basis for understanding Fraunhofer diffraction. We can deduce some important features of this phenomenon by examining waves coming from various portions of the slit, as shown in Fig. 32.19 According to Huygens\u2019s principle, each portion of the slit acts as a source of light waves. Hence, light from one portion of the slit can interfere with light from another portion, and the resultant light intensity on a viewing screen depends on the direction q. Chapter 32 Interference and Diffraction of Light \u0097 211 q Incoming wave Slit Lens Viewing screen Fig. 32.18 Fraunhofer diffraction pattern of a single slit. 1 2 3 4 5 a a/2 a/2 a 2 sin q q Fig. 32.19 Diffraction of light by a narrow slit of width a. Each portion of the slit acts as a point source of light waves. The path difference between rays 1 and 3 or between rays 2 and 4 is ( / ) sin a 2 q (drawing not to scale).  To analyze the diffraction pattern, it is convenient to divide the slit into two halves, as shown in Fig. 32.19. Keeping in mind that all the waves are in phase as they leave the slit, consider rays 1 and 3. As these two rays travel toward a viewing screen far to the right of the Fig. 32.19, ray 1 travels farther than ray 3 by an amount equal to the path difference ( / ) sin a 2 q, where a is the width of the slit. Similarly, the path difference between rays 2 and 4 is also ( / ) sin a 2 q. If this path difference is exactly half a wavelength (corresponding to a phase difference of 180\u00b0), then the two waves cancel each other and destructive interference results. This is true for any two rays that originate at points separated by half the slit width because the phase difference between two such points is 180\u00b0. Therefore, waves from the upper half of the slit interfere destructively with waves from the lower half when a 2 2 sin q l = or when sin q l = a If we divide the slit into four equal parts and use similar reasoning, we find that the viewing screen is also dark when sin q l = 2 a Likewise, we can divide the slit into six equal parts and show that darkness occurs on the screen when sin q l = 3 a Therefore, the general condition for destructive interference is sin q l = m a m = \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00bc 1 2 3 , , , \u2026(i) This equation gives the values of q for which the diffraction pattern has zero light intensity\u2014that is, when a dark fringe is formed. However, it tells us nothing about the variation in light intensity along the screen. The general features of the intensity distribution are shown in Fig. 32.20. A broad central bright fringe is observed; this fringe is flanked by much weaker bright fringes alternating with dark fringes. The various dark fringes occur at the values of q that satisfy Eq. (i). Each bright fringe peak lies approximately halfway between its bordering dark fringe minima. Note that the central bright maximum is twice as wide as the secondary maxima. 212 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics q Viewing screen a y2 sin = 2 / q l a y1 0 sin = / q l a sin = 0 q \u2013y1 sin = \u2013 / q l a \u2013y2 sin = \u20132 / q l a L Fig. 32.20 Intensity distribution for a Fraunhofer diffraction pattern from a single slit of width a  Intensity of Single Slit Diffraction Patterns We can use phasor to determine the light intensity distribution for a single slit diffraction pattern.

From this result, we see that minima occurs when p q l p a m sin = or sin q l = m a m = \u00b1 \u00b1 \u00bc 1 2 , , This is in agreement with Eq. (i). Note That sin q = 0, corresponds to central maxima while p q l p a sin = , corresponds to first minima.

Shape of fringes on complete screen Until now, we have discussed the fringe pattern on the centre line of the screen. On this centre line maximas (likeY Y Y 0 1 2 , , ) etc. or minimas (like y y 1 2 , ) etc. are just points. But on the whole screen fringes make a curve and this curve is a locus of points where path difference from two slits is a constant. Or Dx ",

In the first type either source or screen or both are at finite distance from the diffracting device (obstacle or aperture). In the second type both source and screen are effectively at infinite distance from the diffracting device. Fraunhofer diffraction is a particular limiting case of Fresnel diffraction. 6. Difference between interference and diffraction Both interference and diffraction are the results of superposition of waves, so they are often present simultaneously as in Young\u2019s double slit experiment. However, interference is the result of superposition of waves from two different wavefronts while diffraction results due to superposition of wavelets from different points of the same wavefronts.

        "content": "Based on YDSE Note Unless mentioned in the question consider two sources S1 and S2 as coherent. Type 1. Based on interference by thin films Concept Interference effects are commonly observed in thin films, such as thin layers of oil on water or the thin surface of a soap bubble. The varied colours observed when white light is incident on such films result from the interference of waves reflected from the two surfaces of the film. Consider a film of uniform thickness t and index of refraction m, as shown in figure. Let us assume that the light rays travelling in air are nearly normal to the two surfaces of the film. To determine whether the reflected rays interfere constructively or destructively, we first note the following facts. (i) The wavelength of light in a medium whose refractive index is m, is l l m m = where, l is the wavelength of light in vacuum (or air). (ii) If a wave is reflected from a denser medium, it undergoes a phase change of 180\u00b0. Let us apply these rules to the film shown in figure. The path difference between the two rays 1 and 2 is 2t while the phase difference between them is 180\u00b0. Hence, condition of constructive interference will be 2 2 1 2 t n = ( \u2013 ) lm ( , , , ) n = \u00bc 1 2 3 or 2 1 2 m l t n = \u00e6 \u00e8\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8\u00f7 \u2013 as l l m m = \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 Similarly, condition of destructive interference will be 2 m l t n = ( , , , ) n = \u00bc 0 1 2 Note Where there is a phase difference of p between two interfering rays, conditions of maximas and minimas are interchanged. Solved Examples B 180\u00b0 phase change No phase change 1 2 Air A Air B mair film > m t Film  V Example 1 Calculate the minimum thickness of a soap bubble film ( ) m = 1.33 that results in constructive interference in the reflected light if the film is illuminated with light whose wavelength in free space is l = 600 nm. Solution For constructive interference in case of soap film, 2 1 2 m l t n = \u00e6 \u00e8\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8\u00f7 \u2013 ( , , , ) n = \u00bc 1 2 3 For minimum thickness t, n = 1 or 2 2 m l t = or t = = \u00b4 l m 4 600 4 1.33 = 112.78 nm Ans. V Example 2 In solar cells, a silicon solar cell ( m = 3.5) is coated with a thin film of silicon monoxide SiO ( ) m = 1.45 to minimize reflective losses from the surface. Determine the minimum thickness of SiO that produces the least reflection at a wavelength of 550 nm, near the centre of the visible spectrum. Assume approximately normal incidence. Solution The reflected light is a minimum when rays 1 and 2 (shown in figure) meet the condition of destructive interference. Note Both rays undergo a 180\u00b0 phase change upon reflection. The net change in phase due to reflection is therefore zero, and the condition for a reflection minimum requires a path difference of l / m 2. Hence, 2 2 t = l m or t = = l m 4 550 4 (1.45) = 94.8 nm Ans. Type 2. Based on conditions of maxima or minima Concept (i) In the problems of YDSE, our first task is to find the path difference. Let us take a typical case. In the figure shown, path of ray 1 is more than path of ray 2 by a distance, Dx d 1 = sina and Dx t 2 1 1 1 = ( \u2013 ) m Chapter 32 Interference and Diffraction of Light \u0097 217 180 phase change \u00b0 180 phase change \u00b0 1 2 Air SiO Si m = 1 m = 1.45 m = 3.5 t  and path of ray 2 is greater than path of ray 1 by a distance, Dx yd D 3 = and Dx t 4 2 2 1 = ( \u2013 ) m Therefore, net path difference is D D D D D x x x x x = + + ( ) ~ ( ) 1 2 3 4 (ii) Once the path difference is known, put Dx n = l (for maximum intensity) and Dx n = ( \u2013 ) 2 1 2 l (for minimum intensity) Note If medium is not air or medium is different on two sides of the slits, then for conditions of maxima/minima phase difference between two interfering beams is more important rather than the path difference. For phase difference, we will use Df or f = 2p l ( ) Dx Here, l is the wavelength in that particular medium. V Example 3 Distance between two slits is d. Wavelength of light is l. There is a source of light S behind S2 at a distance D1. A glass slab of thickness t and refractive index m is kept in front of S1. Find (a) Net path difference at point P at an angular position q. (b) Write the equation for finding two angular positions corresponding to second order minima (y2 and y2\u00a2 ).

The mechanics of particles and the optics of waves are traditionally independent disciplines, each with its own chain of principles based on their results. We regard electrons as particles because they possess charge and mass and behave according to the laws of particle mechanics in such familiar devices as television picture tubes. We shall see, however, that it is just as correct to interpret a moving electron as a wave manifestation as it is to interpret it as a particle manifestation. We regard electromagnetic waves as waves because under suitable circumstances they exhibit diffraction, interference and polarization. Similarly, we shall see that under other circumstances they behave as a stream of particles. Rather we can say that they have the dual nature. The wave nature of light (a part of electromagnetic waves) was first demonstrated by Thomas Young, who observed the interference pattern of two coherent sources. The particle nature of light was first proposed by Albert Einstein in 1905 in his explanation of the photoelectric effect. A particle of light called a photon has energy E that is related to the frequency f and wavelength l of light wave by the Einstein equation, E hf hc = = l \u2026(i) where, c is the speed of light (in vacuum) and h is Planck's constant. h = \u00b4 - 6626 10 34 . J-s = \u00b4 - 4136 10 15 . eV-s Since, energies are often given in electron volt (1 eV = \u00b4 - 16 10 19 . J) and wavelengths are in \u00c5, it is convenient to the combination hc in eV-\u00c5. We have, hc =12375 eV-\u00c5 Hence, Eq. (i) in simpler form can be written as E ( ) ( in eV in \u00c5) = 12375 l \u2026(ii) The propagation of light is governed by its wave properties, whereas the exchange of energy between light with matter is governed by its particle properties. The wave particle duality is a general property of nature. For example, electrons (and other so called particles) also propagate as waves and exchange energy as particles. 33.2 Electromagnetic Spectrum The basic source of electromagnetic wave is an accelerated charge. This produces the changing electric and magnetic fields which constitute an electromagnetic wave. An electromagnetic wave may have its wavelength varying from zero to infinity. Not all of them are known till date. Today we are familiar with electromagnetic waves having wavelengths as small as 30 fm (1 fm = - 10 15 m) to as large as 30 km. The boundaries separating different regions of spectrum are not sharply defined, with the exception of the visible part of the spectrum. The visible part of the electromagnetic spectrum covers from 4000 \u00c5 to 7000 \u00c5. An approximate range of wavelengths is associated with each colour : 254 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  violet (4000 \u00c5\u2013 4500 \u00c5), blue (4500 \u00c5\u20135200 \u00c5), green (5200 \u00c5\u20135600 \u00c5), yellow (5600 \u00c5\u20136000 \u00c5), orange (6000 \u00c5\u2013 6250 \u00c5) and red (6250 \u00c5\u20137000 \u00c5). Figure shows the spectrum of electromagnetic waves. The classification is based roughly on how the waves are produced and or detected. g-Rays These were identified by P. Villiard in 1900. These are usually produced within the nucleus of an atom and extremely energetic by atomic standards. They cover the range from 0.1 \u00c5 down or equivalently from1020 Hz up. X-Rays X-rays, discovered in 1895 by W. Roentgen extend from 100 \u00c5 to 0.1 \u00c5. These are produced by the rapid deceleration of electrons that bombard a heavy metal target. These are also produced by electronic transitions between the energy levels in an atom. X-rays are used to study the atomic structure of crystals or molecules such as DNA. Besides their diagnostic and therapeutic use in medicine they have become an important tool in studying the universe. Ultraviolet radiation Ultraviolet (UV) rays were first discovered by J.W. Ritter in 1801. The ultraviolet region extends from 4000 \u00c5 to 100 \u00c5. It plays a role in the production of vitamin D in our skins. But prolonged doses of UV radiation can induce cancers in humans. Glass absorbs UV radiation and hence, can provide some protection against the sun's rays. If the ozone in our atmosphere did not absorb the UV below 3000 \u00c5, there would be a large number of cell mutations, especially cancerous ones, in humans. For this reason, the depletion of the ozone in our atmosphere by chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) is now a matter of international concern. Visible light A lot of discussion has already been done on visible light in previous chapters. As electrons undergo transitions between energy levels in an atom, light is produced at well defined wavelengths. Light covering a continuous range of wavelengths is produced by the random acceleration of electrons in hot bodies. Our sense of vision and the process of photosynthesis in plants have evolved within the range of those wavelengths of sunlight that our atmosphere does not absorb. Infrared radiation The infrared region (IR) starts at 7000 \u00c5 and extends to about 1 mm. It was discovered in 1800 by M. Herchel. It is associated with the vibration and rotation of molecules and is perceived by us as heat. IR is used in the early detection of tumours. Microwaves Microwaves cover wavelengths from 1 mm to about 15 cm. Microwaves upto about 30 GHz (1 cm) may be generated by the oscillations of electrons in a device called klystron. Microwave ovens are used in kitchens. Modern intercity communications such as phone conversations and TV programs are often carried via a cross country network of microwave antennas. Radio and TV signals Radio waves are generated when charges are accelerating through conducting wires. Their wavelengths lie in the range 1014 m to 10 cm. They are generated by LC oscillators and are used in radio and television communication systems.

His ideas can be expressed quantitatively by first considering electromagnetic radiation. A photon of frequency f and wavelength l has energy. E hf hc = = l By Einstein's energy mass relation, E mc = 2 the equivalent mass m of the photon is given by m E c hf c h c = = = 2 2 l \u2026(i) or l = h mc or h p \u2026(ii) Here, p is the momentum of photon. By analogy de-Broglie suggested that a particle of mass m moving with speed v behaves in some ways like waves of wavelength l given by l = = h mv h p \u2026(iii) where, p is the momentum of the particle. Momentum is related to the kinetic energy by the equation, p Km = 2 and a charge q when accelerated by a potential difference V gains a kinetic energy K qV = . Combining all these relations Eq. (iii) can be written as l = = = = h mv h p h Km h qVm 2 2 (de-Broglie wavelength) \u2026(iv) de-Broglie Wavelength for an Electron If an electron (charge = e) is accelerated by a potential difference of V volts, it acquires a kinetic energy, K eV = Chapter 33 Modern Physics - I \u0097 257  Substituting the values of h, m and q in Eq. (iv), we get a simple formula for calculating de-Broglie wavelength of an electron.  This is l ( ( in \u00c5) in volts) = 150 V \u2026(v) Note If an electron is accelerated by 1 volt, then its kinetic energy becomes 1 eV. Therefore, the above formula can also be written as l ( ) ( ) in A KE in eV o = 150 V Example 33.2 An electron is accelerated by a potential difference of 25 volt. Find the de-Broglie wavelength associated with it. Solution For an electron, de-Broglie wavelength is given by l = 150 V = 150 25 = 6 \u00bb 2.5 \u00c5 Ans. V Example 33.3 A particle of mass M at rest decays into two particles of masses m m 1 2 and having non-zero velocities.

V Example 33.4 The energy of a photon is equal to the kinetic energy of a proton. The energy of the photon is E.

In the present article and in the next, our chief concern will be the structure of the atom, since it is this structure that is responsible for nearly all the properties of matter.In nineteenth century many models were present by different scientists, but ultimately the first theory of the atom to meet with any success was put forward in 1913 by Neils Bohr. But before studying Bohr's model of atom let us have a look on other two models of the period one presented by J.J. Thomson in 1898 and the other by Ernest Rutherford in 1911. J.J. Thomson suggested that atoms are just positively charged lumps of matter with electrons embedded in them like raisins in a fruit cake. Thomson's model called the \u2018plum pudding\u2019 model is illustrated in Fig. 33.2. Thomson had played an important role in discovering the electron, his idea was taken seriously. But, the real atom turned out to be quite different. Rutherford's Nuclear Atom The nuclear atom is the basis of the modern theory of atomic structure and was proposed by Rutherford in 1911. He, with his two assistants Geiger and Marsden did an experiment in which they directed a narrow beam ofa-particles onto gold foil about1mm thick and found that while most of the 260 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 33.1 Electron Positively charged matter Fig. 33.2 The Thomson model of the atom. The Rutherford scattering experiment showed it to be incorrect.  particles passed straight through, some were scattered appreciably and a very few about 1 in 8000 suffered deflection of more than 90\u00b0. To account for this very surprising result Rutherford suggested that : \u201cAll the positive charge and nearly all the mass were concentrated in a very small volume or nucleus at the centre of the atom. The electrons were supposed to move in circular orbits round the nucleus (like planets round the sun). The electrostatic attraction between the two opposite charges being the required centripetal force for such motion. The large angle scattering of a-particles would then be explained by the strong electrostatic repulsion from the nucleus. Rutherford's model of the atom, although strongly supported by evidence for the nucleus, is inconsistent with classical physics. An electron moving in a circular orbit round a nucleus is accelerating and according to electromagnetic theory it should therefore, emit radiation continuously and thereby lose energy. If this happened the radius of the orbit would decrease and the electron would spiral into the nucleus in a fraction of second. But atoms do not collapse. In 1913, an effort was made by Neils Bohr to overcome this paradox. 33.6 The Bohr Hydrogen Atom After Neils Bohr obtained his doctorate in 1911, he worked under Rutherford for a while. In 1913, he presented a model of the hydrogen atom, which has one electron and one proton. He postulated that an electron moves only in certain circular orbits, called stationary orbits. In stationary orbits, electron does not emit radiation, contrary to the predictions of classical electromagnetic theory. According to Bohr, there is a definite energy associated with each stable orbit and an atom radiates energy only when it makes a transition from one of these orbits to another. The energy is radiated in the form of a photon with energy and frequency given by ",

In ground state (n =1), energy of atom is \u201313.6 eV and energy corresponding to n = \u00a5 is zero. Hence, energy required to remove the electron from ground state is 13.6 eV. Emission spectrum of hydrogen atom Under normal conditions the single electron in hydrogen atom stays in ground state (n =1). It is excited to some higher energy state when it acquires some energy from external source. But, it hardly stays there for more than10 8 - second. A photon corresponding to a particular spectrum line is emitted when an atom makes a transition from a state in an excited level to a state in a lower excited level or the ground level. Let ni be the initial and n f the final energy state, then depending on the final energy state following series are observed in the emission spectrum of hydrogen atom. For the Lyman series n f =1, for Balmer series n f = 2 and so on. The relation of the various spectral series to the energy levels and to electron orbits is shown in figure.

If Ei is the initial energy of the atom before such a transition, E f is its final energy after the transition, and the photon's energy is hf hc = l , then conservation of energy gives hf hc E E i f = = - l (energy of emitted photon) \u2026(xii) By 1913, the spectrum of hydrogen had been studied intensively. The visible line with longest wavelength, or lowest frequency is in the red and is called Ha, the next line, in the blue-green is called Hb and so on. In 1885, Johann Balmer, a swiss teacher found a formula that gives the wave lengths of these lines. This is now called the Balmer series. The Balmer's formula is 1 1 2 1 2 2 l = - \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7 R n \u2026(xiii) Here, n = 3 4 5 , , ..., etc. R = Rydberg constant = \u00b4 - 1.097 m 107 1 and l is the wavelength of light/photon emitted during transition. For n = 3, we obtain the wavelength of Ha line. Similarly, for n = 4, we obtain the wavelength of Hb line. For n = \u00a5, the smallest wavelength (= 3646 \u00c5) of this series is obtained. Using the relation E hc = l , we can find the photon energies corresponding to the wavelength of the Balmer series. Multiplying Eq.

In such atoms, the nuclear charge is +Ze, where Z is the atomic number, equal to the number of protons in the nucleus. The effect in the previous analysis is to replace e2 everywhere by Ze2. Thus, the equations for, rn , vn and En are altered as under r n h mZe n Z a n = = e p 0 2 2 2 2 0 or r n Z n \u00b5 2 \u2026(i) where, a 0 = 0.529 \u00c5 (radius of first orbit of H) v Ze nh Z n v n = = 2 0 1 2e or v Z n n \u00b5 \u2026(ii) where, v1 6 10 = \u00b4 2.19 m/s (speed of electron in first orbit of H) E mZ e n h Z n E n = = \u2013 2 4 0 2 2 2 2 2 1 8e or E Z n n \u00b5 2 2 \u2026(iii) where, E1 = \u201313.60eV (energy of atom in first orbit of H) Fig. 33.6 compares the energy levels of H and He + which has Z = 2. H and He + have many spectrum lines that have almost the same wavelengths Chapter 33 Modern Physics - I \u0097 265 n = 3 n = 2 n = 1 E3 = \u20131.5 eV E2 = \u20133.4 eV E1 = \u201313.6 eV H E n = 4 E4 = \u20133.4 eV n = 5 E5 = \u20132.2 eV n = 6 E6 = \u20131.5 eV n = 3 n = 2 E3 = \u20136.0 eV E2 = \u201313.6 eV n = 1 E1 = \u201354.4 eV He+ Fig. 33.6 Energy levels of H and He+ . Because of the additional factor Z 2 in the energy expression, the energy of theHe+ ion with a given n is almost exactly four times that of the H-atom with the same n. There are small differences (of the order of 0.05%) because of the different masses.  \u0098 Bohr\u2019s theory is applicable for hydrogen and hydrogen like atoms/ions. For such types of atoms/ions number of electron is one. Although, atomic numbers may be different. e.g, For 1 1 H , atomic number Z = 1, For He+, atomic number Z = 2 and For Li+2, atomic number Z = 3 But for all three number of electron is one. \u0098 In nth orbit mv r e Ze r 2 0 2 1 4 = e \u00d7 p ( )( ) and L mvr nh n = = 2 p After solving these two equations, we will get following results.

For example, total number of lines from n n 1 = to n2 1 = are n n ( \u2013 )1 2 . \u0098 As the principal quantum number n is increased in hydrogen and hydrogen like atoms, some quantities are decreased and some are increased.

K U =| | 2 and E K U = = \u2013 2 If force is not proportional to 1 2r or potential energy is not proportional to 1 r, the above relations do not hold good. 266 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Extra Points to Remember  \u0098 Total energy of a closed system is always negative and the modulus of this is the binding energy of the system. For instance, suppose a system has a total energy of \u2013100 J. It means that this system will separate if 100 J of energy is supplied to this. Hence, binding energy of this system is 100 J. Thus, total energy of an open system is either zero or greater than zero. \u0098 Kinetic energy of a particle can\u2019t be negative, while the potential energy can be zero, positive or negative. It basically depends on the reference point where we have taken it zero. It is customary to take zero potential energy when the electron is at infinite distance from the nucleus.

Chapter 33 Modern Physics - I \u0097 271 INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 33.2 5E 4E E  33.8 X-Rays Electromagnetic radiation with wavelengths from 0.1 \u00c5 to 100 \u00c5 falls into the category of X-rays. The boundaries of this category are not sharp. The shorter wavelength end overlaps gamma rays and the longer wavelength end overlaps ultraviolet rays. Photoelectric effect (will be discussed later) provides convincing evidence that photons of light can transfer energy to electrons. Is the inverse process also possible? That is, can part or all of the kinetic energy of a moving electron be converted into a photon? Yes, it is possible. In 1895 Wilhelm Roentgen found that a highly penetrating radiation of unknown nature is produced when fast moving electrons strike a target of high atomic number and high melting point. These radiations were given a name X-rays as their nature was unknown (in mathematics an unknown quantity is normally designated by X). Later, it was discovered that these are high energy photons (or electromagnetic waves). Production of X-Rays Figure shows a diagram of a X-ray tube, called the coolidge tube. A cathode (a plate connected to negative terminal of a battery), heated by a filament through which an electric current is passed, supplies electrons by thermionic emission. The high potential difference V maintained between the cathode and a metallic target accelerate the electrons toward the later. The face of the target is at an angle relative to the electron beam, and the X-rays that leave the target pass through the side of the tube. The tube is evacuated to permit the electrons to get to the target unimpedded. Continuous and characteristic X-rays X-rays so produced by the coolidge tube are of two types, continuous and characteristic. While the former depends only on the accelerating voltage V, the later depends on the target used. Continuous X-rays Electromagnetic theory predicts that an accelerated electric charge will radiate electromagnetic waves, and a rapidly moving electrons when suddenly brought to rest is certainly accelerated (of course negative). X-rays produced under these circumstances is given the German name bremsstrahlung (braking radiation). Energy loss due to bremsstrahlung is more important for electrons than for heavier particles because electrons are more violently accelerated when passing near nuclei in their paths. The continuous X-rays (or bremsstrahlung X-rays) produced at a given accelerating potential V vary in wavelength, but none has a wavelength shorter than a certain value l min . This minimum wavelength corresponds to the maximum energy of the X-rays which in turn is equal to the maximum kinetic energy qV or eV of the striking electrons. Thus, hc eV lmin = or lmin = hc eV 272 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics \u2013 + Target Cathode Evacuated tube X-rays V Fig. 33.7 An X-ray tube. The higher the accelerating voltage V, the faster the electrons and the shorter the wavelengths of the X-rays  After substituting values of h c , and e we obtain the following simple formula for l min . l min ( ) ( ) in \u00c5 in volts = 12375 V \u2026(i) Increasing V decreases l min . This wavelength is also known as the cut off wavelength or the threshold wavelength. Characteristic X-rays The X-ray spectrum typically consists of a broad continuous band containing a series of sharp lines as shown in Fig. 33.8. As discussed above the continuous spectrum is the result of collisions between incoming electrons and atoms in the target. The kinetic energy lost by the electrons during the collisions emerges as the energy of the X-ray photons radiated from the target. The sharp lines superimposed on the continuous spectrum are known as characteristic X-rays because they are characteristic of the target material. They were discovered in 1908, but their origin remained unexplained until the details of atomic structure, particularly the shell structure of the atom, were discovered. Characteristic X-ray emission occurs when a bombarding electron that collides with a target atom has sufficient energy to remove an inner shell electron from the atom. The vacancy created in the shell is filled when an electron from a higher level drops down into it. This transition is accompanied by the emission of a photon whose energy equals the difference in energy between the two levels. Let us assume that the incoming electron has dislodged an atomic electron from the innermost shell-the K shell. If the vacancy is filled by an electron dropping from the next higher shell the L shell, the photon emitted has an energy corresponding to the Ka characteristic X-ray line. If the vacancy is filled by an electron dropping from the M shell, the Kb line is produced. An La line is produced as an electron drops from the M shell to the L-shell, and an Lb line is produced by a transition from the N-shell to the L-shell. Moseley\u2019s Law for Characteristic Spectrum Although multi-electron atoms cannot be analyzed with the Bohr model, Henery G.J. Moseley in 1914 made an effort towards this. Moseley measured the frequencies of characteristic X-rays from a large number of elements and plotted the square root of the frequency f against the atomic number Chapter 33 Modern Physics - I \u0097 273 La Ka Kb Lb Lg Fig. 33.8 X-ray spectrum N M L M-series L-series K-series Ka Kb La Lb Kg Fig. 33.9  Z of the element. He discovered that the plot is very close to a straight line. He plotted the square root of the frequency of the Ka line versus the atomic number Z. As figure shows, Moseley\u2019s plot did not pass through the origin. Let us see why. It can be understood from Gauss\u2019s law. Consider an atom of atomic number Z in which one of the two electrons in the K-shell has been ejected. Imagine that we draw a Gaussian sphere just inside the most probable radius of the L-electrons. The effective charge inside the Gaussian surface is the positive nuclear charge and one negative charge due to the single K-electron. If we ignore the interactions between L-electrons, a single L electron behaves as if it experiences an electric field due to a charge ( \u2013 ) Z 1 enclosed by the Gaussian surface. Thus, Moseley\u2019s law of the frequency of Ka line is f a Z K a = ( \u2013 )1 \u2026(ii) where, a is a constant that can be related to Bohr theory. The above law in general can be stated as under f a Z b = ( \u2013 ) or f Z b \u00b5 - ( ) \u2026(iii) For Ka line, ",

Further, we can see that for a given atomic number (say Z0). f f K L > \u0098 Screening effect The energy levels, in general, depend on the principal quantum number (n) and orbital quantum number (l). Let us take sodium ( ) Z = 11 as an example. According to Gauss\u2019s law, for any spherically symmetric charge distribution the electric field magnitude at a distance r from the centre is 1 4 0 2 pe q r encl , where qencl is the total charge enclosed within a sphere with radius r. Mentally, remove the outer (valence) electron from a sodium atom. What you have left is a spherically symmetric collection of 10 electrons (filling the K and L shells) and 11 protons. So, q e e e encl = + = + \u2013 10 11 If the eleventh is completely outside this collection of charges, it is attracted by an effective charge of +e, not + 11e. This effect is called screening, the 10 electrons screen 10 of the 11 protons leaving an effective net charge of +e. In general, an electron that spends all its time completely outside a positive charge Z e eff has energy levels given by the hydrogen expression with e2 replaced by Z e eff 2. i.e. E Z n n = \u2013 ( ) eff 13.6 eV 2 2 (energy levels with screening) If the eleventh electron in the sodium atom is completely outside the remaining charge distribution, then Zeff = 1.

The rest of the kinetic energy converts into internal energy of the target which simultaneously has to be kept cool by circulating oil or water. \u0098 Atomic number of the target material should be high.

(JEE 2003) 278 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 33.3 l lc I lk Fig. 33.12  33.9 Emission of Electrons At room temperature the free electrons move randomly within the conductor, but they don\u2019t leave the surface of the conductor due to attraction of positive charges. Some external energy is required to emit electrons from a metal surface. Minimum energy is required to emit the electrons which are just on the surface of the conductor. This minimum energy is called the work-function (denoted byW) of the conductor. Work-function is the property of the metallic surface. The energy required to liberate an electron from metal surface may arise from various sources such as heat, light, electric field etc. Depending on the nature of source of energy, the following methods are possible : (i) Thermionic emission The energy to the free electrons can be given by heating the metal. The electrons so emitted are known as thermions. (ii) Field emission When a conductor is put under strong electric field, the free electrons on it experience an electric force in the opposite direction of field. Beyond a certain limit, electrons start coming out of the metal surface. Emission of electrons from a metal surface by this method is called the field emission. (iii) Secondary emission Emission of electrons from a metal surface by the bombardment of high speed electrons or other particles is known as secondary emission. (iv) Photoelectric emission Emission of free electrons from a metal surface by falling light (or any other electromagnetic wave which has an energy greater than the work-function of the metal) is called photoelectric emission. The electrons so emitted are called photoelectrons. 33.10 Photoelectric Effect When light of an appropriate frequency (or correspondingly of an appropriate wavelength) is incident on a metallic surface, electrons are liberated from the surface. This observation is known as photoelectric effect. Photoelectric effect was first observed in 1887 by Hertz. For photoemission to take place, energy of incident light photons should be greater than or equal to the work-function of the metal. or E W \u00b3 \u2026(i) \\ hf W \u00b3 or f W h \u00b3 Here, W h is the minimum frequency required for the emission of electrons. This is known as threshold frequency f 0. Thus, f W h 0 = (threshold frequency) \u2026(ii) Further, Eq. (i) can be written as hc W l \u00b3 or l \u00a3 hc W Chapter 33 Modern Physics - I \u0097 279  Here, hc W is the largest wavelength beyond which photoemission does not take place. This is called the threshold wavelength l 0. Thus, l 0 = hc W (threshold wavelength) \u2026(iii) Hence, for the photoemission to take place either of the following conditions must be satisfied. E W \u00b3 or f f \u00b3 0 or l l \u00a3 0 \u2026(iv) Stopping Potential and Maximum Kinetic Energy of Photoelectrons When the frequency f of the incident light is greater than the threshold frequency, some electrons are emitted from the metal with substantial initial speeds. Suppose E is the energy of light incident on a metal surface and W E ( ) < the work-function of metal. As minimum energy is required to extract electrons from the surface, they will have the maximum kinetic energy which is E W \u2013 . Thus, K E W max \u2013 = \u2026(v) This value K max can experimentally be found by keeping the metal plate P (from which electrons are emitting) at higher potential relative to an another plate Q placed in front of P. Some electrons after emitting from plate P, reach the plate Q despite the fact that Q is at lower potential and it is repelling the electrons from reaching in itself. This is because the electrons emitted from plate P possess some kinetic energy and due to this energy they reach the plate Q and current i flows in the circuit in the direction shown in figure. As the potential V is increased, the force of repulsion to the electrons gets increased and less number of electrons reach the plate Q and current in the circuit gets decreased. At a certain valueV0 electrons having maximum kinetic energy (K max ) also get stopped and current in the circuit becomes zero. This is called the stopping potential. As an electron moves from P to Q, the potential decreases byV0 and negative work \u2013 eV0 is done on the (negatively charged) electron, the most energetic electron leaves plate P with kinetic energy K mv max max = 1 2 2 and has zero kinetic energy at Q. Using the work energy theorem, we have W eV K K ext = = = \u2013 \u2013 max 0 0 D or K mv eV max max = = 1 2 2 0 \u2026(vi) 280 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Light G P Q V i Fig. 33.13  Photoelectric Current Figure shows an apparatus used to study the variation of photocurrent i with the intensity and frequency of light falling on metal plate P. Photoelectrons are emitted from plate P which are being attracted by the positive plate Q and a photoelectric current i flows in the circuit, which can be measured by the galvanometer G. Figure 33.15 (a) shows graphs of photocurrent as a function of potential differenceVQP for light of constant frequency and two different intensities. When VQP is sufficiently large and positive the current becomes constant, showing that all the emitted electrons are being collected by the anode plate Q. The stopping potential difference \u2013V0 needed to reduce the current to zero is shown. If the intensity of light is increased, (or we can say the number of photons incident per unit area per unit time is increased) while its frequency is kept the same, the current becomes constant at a higher value, showing that more electrons are being emitted per unit time. But the stopping potential is found to be the same. Figure 33.15 (b) shows current as a function of potential difference for two different frequencies with the same intensity in each case. We see that when the frequency of the incident monochromatic light is increased, the stopping potentialV0 gets increased. Of course,V0 turn out to be a linear function of the frequency f.

(i) Wave theory suggests that the kinetic energy of the photoelectrons should increase with the increase in intensity of light. However equation, K eV max = 0 suggests that it is independent of the intensity of light. (ii) According to wave theory, the photoelectric effect should occur for any frequency of the light, provided that the light is intense enough. However, the above equation suggests that photoemission is possible only when frequency of incident light is either greater than or equal to the threshold frequency f0. (iii) If the energy to the photoelectrons is obtained by soaking up from the incident wave, it is not likely that the effective target area for an electron in the metal is much more than a few atomic diameters. (see example 33.20) between the impinging of the light on the surface and the ejection of the photoelectrons. During this interval the electron should be \u201csoaking up\u201d energy from the beam until it had accumulated enough energy to escape. However, no detectable time lag has ever been measured. \u0098 Einstein\u2019s photon theory Einstein succeeded in explaining the photoelectric effect by making a remarkable assumption, that the energy in a light beam travels through space in concentrated bundles, called photons. The energy E of a single photon is given by E hf = Applying the photon concept to the photoelectric effect, Einstein wrote hf W K = + max (already discussed) Consider how Einstein\u2019s photon hypothesis meets the three objections raised against the wave theory interpretation of the photoelectric effect. As for objection 1 (the lack of dependence of Kmax on the intensity of illumination), doubling the light intensity merely doubles the number of photons and thus doubles the photoelectric current, it does not change the energy of the individual photons Objection 2 (the existence of a cutoff frequency) follows from equation hf W K = + max. If Kmax equals zero, We have hf W 0 = which asserts that the photon has just enough energy to eject the photoelectrons and none extra to appear as kinetic energy. The quantity W is called the work-function of the substance. If f is reduced below f0, the individual photons, no matter how many of them there are (that is, no matter how intense the illumination), will not have enough energy to eject photo electrons. Objection 3 (the absence of a time lag) follows from the photon theory because the required energy is supplied in a concentrated bundle. It is not spread uniformly over a large area, as in the wave theory. Although, the photon hypothesis certainly fits the facts of photoelectricity, it seems to be in direct conflict with the wave theory of light. Out modern view of the nature of light is that it has a dual character, behaving like a wave under some circumstances and like a particle or photon under others. V Example 33.20 A metal plate is placed 5 m from a monochromatic light source whose power output is 10 3 \u2013 W. Consider that a given ejected photoelectron may collect its energy from a circular area of the plate as large as ten atomic diameters ( ) \u2013 10 9 m in radius. The energy required to remove an electron through the metal surface is about 5.0 eV . Assuming light to be a wave, how long would it take for such a \u2018target\u2019 to soak up this much energy from such a light source. Solution The target area is S1 9 2 18 2 10 10 = = \u00b4 p p ( ) \u2013 \u2013 m . The area of a 5 m sphere centered on the light source is, S 2 2 2 4 5 100 = = p p ( ) m .

Minimum kinetic energy of photoelectrons, K min = 0 and maximum kinetic energy is, K E W max = \u2013 = ( \u2013 ) 10.6 5.6 eV = 5.0 eV Ans. V Example 33.23 Maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons from a metal surface is K 0 when wavelength of incident light is l. If wavelength is decreased to l/2, the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons becomes (a) = 2 0 K (b) > 2 0 K (c) < 2 0 K 284 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  Solution Using the equation, K E W max = - , we have K hc W 0 = - l K (i) with wavelength l 2 , suppose the maximum kinetic energy is K 0\u00a2 , then K hc W 0 2 \u00a2 = - l/ = - 2 hc W l = - \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7 + 2 hc W W l but hc W l - is K 0. Therefore, K K W 0 0 2 \u00a2 = + or K K 0 0 2 \u00a2 > \\ The correct option is (b). Ans. V Example 33.24 Intensity and frequency of incident light both are doubled. Then, what is the effect on stopping potential and saturation current. Solution By increasing the frequency of incident light energy of incident light will increase. So, maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons will also increase. Hence, stopping potential will increase. Further, by doubling the frequency of incident light energy of each photon will be doubled. So, intensity itself becomes two times without increasing number of photons incident per unit area per unit time. Therefore, saturation current will remain unchanged. V Example 33.25 When a monochromatic point source of light is at a distance of 0.2 m from a photoelectric cell, the cut off voltage and the saturation current are respectively 0.6 V and 18.0 mA. If the same source is placed 0.6 m away from the photoelectric cell, then (JEE 1992) (a) the stopping potential will be 0.2 V (b) the stopping potential will be 0.6 V (c) the saturation current will be 6.0 mA (d) the saturation current will be 2.0 mA Solution (b) Stopping potential depends on two factors \u2013 one the energy of incident light and the other the work-function of the metal. By increasing the distance of source from the cell, neither of the two change. Therefore, stopping potential remains the same. (d) Saturation current is directly proportional to the intensity of light incident on cell and for a point source, intensity I r \u00b51 2 / When distance is increased from 0.2 m to 0.6 m (three times), the intensity and hence the saturation current will decrease 9 times, i.e. the saturation current will be reduced to 2.0 mA. \\ The correct options are (b) and (d). Chapter 33 Modern Physics - I \u0097 285  V Example 33.26 The threshold wavelength for photoelectric emission from a material is 5200 \u00c5. Photoelectrons will be emitted when this material is illuminated with monochromatic radiation from a (1982, 3M) (a) 50 W infrared lamp (b) 1 W infrared lamp (c) 50 W ultraviolet lamp (d) 1 W ultraviolet lamp Solution For photoemission to take place, wavelength of incident light should be less than the threshold wavelength. Wavelength of ultraviolet light < 5200 \u00c5 while that of infrared radiation > 5200 \u00c5. \\ The correct options are (c) and (d). 1. Light of wavelength 2000 \u00c5 is incident on a metal surface of work-function 3.0 eV. Find the minimum and maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons. 2. Is it correct to say that Kmax is proportional to f ? If not, what would a correct statement of the relationship betweenKmax and f ? 3. When a metal is illuminated with light of frequency f, the maximum kinetic energy of the photoelectrons is 1.2 eV. When the frequency is increased by 50%, the maximum kinetic energy increases to 4.2 eV. What is the threshold frequency for this metal? 4. A metal surface is illuminated by light of two different wavelengths 248 nm and 310 nm. The maximum speeds of the photoelectrons corresponding to these wavelengths are u1 and u2, respectively. If the ratio u u 1 2 2 1 : : = and hc = 1240 eV nm, the work-function of the metal is nearly (JEE 2014) (a) 3.7 eV (b) 3.2 eV (c) 2.8 eV (d) 2.5 eV 5. The figure shows the variation of photocurrent with anode potential for a photosensitive surface for three different radiations. Let I I a b , and Ic be the intensities and f f f a b c , and be the frequencies for the curves a, b and c, respectively (JEE 2004) (a) f f I I a b a b = \u00b9 and (b) f f I I a c a c = = and (c) f f I I a b a b = = and (d) f f I I b c b c = = and 6. The work-function of a substance is 4.0 eV. The longest wavelength of light that can cause photoelectron emission from this substance is approximately (JEE 1998) (a) 540 nm (b) 400 nm (c) 310 nm (d) 220 nm 7. The maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons emitted from a surface when photons of energy 6 eV fall on it is 4 eV. The stopping potential in volt is (JEE 1997) (a) 2 (b) 4 (c) 6 (d) 10 8. Photoelectric effect supports quantum nature of light because (JEE 1987) (a) there is a minimum frequency of light below which no photoelectrons are emitted (b) the maximum kinetic energy of photoelectrons depends only on the frequency of light and not on its intensity (c) even when the metal surface is faintly illuminated, the photoelectrons leave the surface immediately (d) electric charge of the photoelectrons is quantised 286 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics INTRODUCTORY EXERCISE 33.4 c b a I V  Final Touch Points 1.

In an experiment on photoelectric effect light of wavelength 400 nm is incident on a metal plate at the rate of 5 W. The potential of the collector plate is made sufficiently positive with respect to emitter so that the current reaches the saturation value. Assuming that on the average one out of every 106 photons is able to eject a photoelectron, find the photocurrent in the circuit. 23. A light beam of wavelength 400 nm is incident on a metal of work-function 2.2 eV. A particular electron absorbs a photon and makes 2 collisions before coming out of the metal (a) Assuming that 10% of existing energy is lost to the metal in each collision find the final kinetic energy of this electron as it comes out of the metal. (b) Under the same assumptions find the maximum number of collisions, the electron should suffer before it becomes  unable to come out of the metal.

The others are unstable that decay to form other nuclides by emittinga andb-particles and g-electromagnetic waves. This process is called radioactivity. It was discovered in 1896 by Henry Becquerel. Whilst the chemical properties of an atom are governed entirely by the number of protons in the nucleus (i.e. the proton number Z), the stability of an atom appears to depend on both the number of protons and the number of neutrons. For light nuclei, the greatest stability is achieved when the numbers of protons and neutrons are approximately equal ( ). N Z \u00bb For heavier nuclei, instability caused by electrostatic repulsion between the protons is minimized when there are more neutrons than protons. Figure shows a plot of N versus Z for the stable nuclei. For mass numbers upto about A = 40, we see that N Z \u00bb . 40Ca is the heaviest stable nucleus for which N Z = . For larger values of Z, the (short range) nuclear force is unable to hold the nucleus together against the (long range) electrical repulsion of the protons unless the number of neutrons exceeds the number of protons. At Bi ( , ) Z A = = 83 209 , the neutron excess is N Z \u2013 = 43. There are no stable nuclides with Z > 83. The nuclide 83 209 Bi is the heaviest stable nucleus. Atoms are radioactive if their nuclei are unstable and spontaneously (and randomly) emit various particles, the a b , and or g radiations. When naturally occurring nuclei are unstable, we call the phenomena natural radioactivity. Other nuclei can be transformed into radioactive nuclei by various means, typically involving irradiation by neutrons, this is called artificial radioactivity. A radioactive nucleus is called a parent nucleus, the nucleus resulting from its decay by particle emission is called daughter nucleus. Daughter nuclei also might be granddaughter nuclei, and so on. There are no son or grandson nuclei. For unstable nuclides and radioactivity, the following points can be made. (i) Disintegrations tend to produce new nuclides near the stability line and continue until a stable nuclide is formed. (ii) Radioactivity is a nuclear property, i.e. a b , and g emission take place from the nucleus. (iii) Nuclear processes involve huge amount of energy so the particle emission rate is independent of temperature and pressure. The rate depends solely on the concentration of the number of atoms of the radioactive substance. (iv) A radioactive substance is either an a-emitter or a b-emitter, g-rays emit with both. 326 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 10 20 30 40 50 60 70 80 90 100 110 120 130 Number of neutrons N Number of protons N Z = Z Line of stability Fig. 34.1 The stable nuclides plotted on a graph of neutron number, N, versus proton number, Z. Note that for heavier nuclides, N is larger relative to Z. The stable nuclides group along a curve called the line of stability.  Alpha Decay An alpha particle is a helium nucleus. Thus, a nucleus emitting an alpha particle loses two protons and two neutrons. Therefore, the atomic number Z decreases by 2, the mass number A decreases by 4 and the neutron number N decreases by 2. The decay can be written as Z A Z A X Y = + - - 2 4 2 4He where, X is the parent nucleus and Y the daughter nucleus. As examples U 238 and Ra 226 are both alpha emitters and decay according to 92 238 90 234 2 4 U Th He \u00be\u00ae + 88 86 222 2 4 Ra Rn He 226 \u00be\u00ae + As a general rule, in any decay sum of mass numbers A and atomic numbers Z must be the same on both sides. Note that a nuclide below the stability line in Fig. 34.2 disintegrates in such a way that its proton number decreases and its neutron to proton ratio increases. In heavy nuclides, this can occur by alpha emission. If the original nucleus has a mass number A that is 4 times an integer, the daughter nucleus and all those in the chain will also have mass numbers equal to 4 times an integer. (Because ina-decay A decreases by 4 and in b-decay it remains the same). Similarly, if the mass number of the original nucleus is 4 1 n + , where n is an integer, all the nuclei in the decay chain will have mass numbers given by 4 1 n + with n decreasing by 1 in each a-decay. We can see therefore, that there are four possible a-decay chains, depending on whether A equals 4n,4 1 n + ,4 2 n + or 4 3 n + , where nis an integer. Series 4 1 n + is now not found. Because its longest lived member (other than the stable end product Bi209) is Np237 which has a half-life of only 2 106 \u00b4 years. Because this is much less than the age of the earth, this series has disappeared. Figure shows the uranium ( ) 4 2 n + series. The series branches at Bi214, which decays either by a-decay to Ti210 or b-decay to Po214. The branches meet at the lead isotope Pb210. Table 34.1 lists the four radioactive series.

A n = + 4 2 The decay of 83 214Bi may proceed either by alpha emission and then beta emission or in the reverse order.  Beta Decay Beta decay can involve the emission of either electrons or positrons. A positron is a form of antimatter which has a charge equal to + e and mass equal to that of an electron. The electrons or positrons emitted in b-decay do not exist inside the nucleus. They are only created at the time of emission, just as photons are created when an atom makes a transition from a higher to a lower energy state. In b\u2013 decay a neutron in the nucleus is transformed into a proton, an electron and an antineutrino. n p e \u00be\u00ae + + \u2013 n To conserve energy and momentum in the process, the emission of an antineutrino ( ) n (alongwith proton and electron) was first suggested by W. Pauli in 1930, but it was first observed experimentally in 1957. Thus, a parent nucleus with atomic number Z and mass number A decays by b\u2013 emission into a daughter with atomic number Z +1and the same mass number A. Z A Z A X Y \u00be\u00be\u00ae + b\u2013 1 b\u2013 decay occurs in nuclei that have too many neutrons. An example of b\u2013 decay is the decay of carbon-14 into nitrogen, 6 14 7 14 C N \u00be\u00ae + + e\u2013 n In b+ decay, a proton changes into a neutron with the emission of a positron (and a neutrino) p n e \u00be\u00ae + + + n Positron ( ) e+ emission from a nucleus decreases the atomic number Z by 1 while keeping the same mass number A.

A typical b+ decay is 7 13 6 13 N C \u00be\u00ae + + + e n Electron capture Electron capture is competitive with positron emission since both processes lead to the same nuclear transformation. This occurs when a parent nucleus captures one of its own orbital electrons and emits a neutrino. Z A Z A X e Y + \u00be\u00ae + - \u20131 1 n In most cases, it is a K-shell electron that is captured, and for this reason the process is referred to as K-capture. One example is the capture of an electron by 4 7 Be 4 7 3 7 Be Li + \u00be\u00ae + e\u2013 n Gamma Decay Very often a nucleus that undergoes radioactive decay (a orb-decay) is left in an excited energy state (analogous to the excited states of the orbiting electrons, except that the energy levels associated with 328 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  the nucleus have much larger energy differences than those involved with the atomic electrons). The typical half-life of an excited nuclear state is10 10 - s. The excited nucleus ( ) * X then undergoes to a lower energy state by emitting a high energy photon, called the g-ray photon. The following sequence of events represents a typical situation in which g-decay occurs. 5 12 6 12 * B C \u00be\u00ae + + e\u2013 n 6 12 * 6 12 C C \u00be\u00ae + g Figure shows decay of B12 nucleus, which undergoes b-decay to either of two levels of C12. It can either decay directly to the ground state ofC12 by emitting a 13.4 MeV electron or undergob-decay to an excited state of 6 12C* followed by g-decay to the ground state. The later process results in the emission of a 9.0 MeV electron and a 4.4 MeV photon. The various pathways by which a radioactive nucleus can undergo decay are summarized in Table 34.2. Note In both a and b-decay, the Z value of a nucleus changes and the nucleus of one element becomes the nucleus of a different element. In g-decay, the element does not change, the nucleus merely goes from an excited state to a less excited state.

This is because after the emission of one alpha particle, atomic number decreases by 2. Further, after the emission of two beta particles atomic number increases by 2. So, finally atomic number remains unchanged. \u0098 From beta emission mass number does not change. Therefore, isobars will be produced.

Find mass number and atomic number of the new nucleus (say Y) after the emission of m alpha - particles and n beta - particles. Solution By the emission of one alpha particle, atomic number decreases by 2 and by the emission of one beta particle atomic number increases by 1. Therefore, the atomic number of nucleus Y is Z Z m n = - + 2 Further, by the emission of one alpha particle mass number decreases by 4 and by the emission of beta particle, mass number does not change. Therefore, the mass number of Y is A A m \u00a2 = - 4 34.2 Radioactive Decay Law Radioactive decay is a random process. Each decay is an independent event and one cannot tell when a particular nucleus will decay. When a particular nucleus decays, it is transformed into another nuclide, which may or may not be radioactive. When there is a very large number of nuclei in a sample, the rate of decay is proportional to the number of nuclei, N, that are present \u2013 dN dt N \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7 \u00b5 or \u2013 dN dt N \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7 = l where, l is called the decay constant. This equation may be expressed in the form dN N dt = \u2013 l and integrated, dN N dt N N t 0 0 \u00f2 \u00f2 = \u2013 l or ln \u2013 N N t 0 \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 = l where, N 0 is the initial number of parent nuclei at t = 0.The number that survives at time t is therefore, N N e t = 0 \u2013l \u2026(i) This function is plotted in Fig. 34.4. 330 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics ",

After a time equal to the mean life time, the number of radioactive nuclei decreases to 1 e times or approximately 37% of their original values. Activity of a Radioactive Substance The decay rate R of a radioactive substance is the number of decays per second. And as we have seen above \u2013 dN dt N \u00b5 or \u2013 dN dt N = l Thus, R dN dt = \u2013 or R N \u00b5 or R N = l or R N e t = l l 0 \u2013 or R R e t = 0 \u2013l \u2026(iv) where, R N 0 0 = l is the activity of the radioactive substance at time t = 0.

Chapter 34 Modern Physics - II \u0097 339  34.4 Equivalence of Mass and Energy In 1905, while developing his special theory of relativity, Einstein made the suggestion that energy and mass are equivalent. He predicted that if the energy of a body changes by an amount E, its mass changes by an amount m given by the equation, E mc = 2 where, c is the speed of light. Everyday examples of energy gain are much too small to produce detectable changes of mass. But in nuclear physics this plays an important role. Mass appears as energy and the two can be regarded as equivalent. In nuclear physics, mass is measured in unified atomic mass units (u), 1u being one-twelfth of the mass of carbon-12 atom and equals 1.66 kg \u00b410 27 \u2013 .It can readily be shown using E mc = 2 that, 1 u mass has energy 931.5 MeV. Thus, 1 2 u 931.5 MeV/c \u00ba or c2 = 931.5 MeV/u A unit of energy may therefore be considered to be a unit of mass. For example, the electron has a rest mass of about 0.5 MeV. If the principle of conservation of energy is to hold for nuclear reactions it is clear that mass and energy must be regarded as equivalent. The implication of E mc = 2 is that any reaction producing an appreciable mass decrease is a possible source of energy. V Example 34.11 Find the increase in mass of water when 1.0 kg of water absorbs 4.2 \u00b4 103 J of energy to produce a temperature rise of 1 K. Solution m E c = = \u00b4 \u00b4 2 3 8 2 10 10 4.2 3.0 kg ( ) = \u00b4 - 4.7 kg 10 14 Ans. 34.5 Binding Energy and Nuclear Stability The existence of a stable nucleus means that the nucleons (protons and neutrons) are in a bound state. Since, the protons in a nucleus experience strong electrical repulsion, there must exist a stronger attractive force that holds the nucleus together. The nuclear force is a short range interaction that extends only to about 2 fm. (In contrast, the electromagnetic interaction is a long-range interaction). An important feature of the nuclear force is that it is essentially the same for all nucleons, independent of charge. The binding energy ( ) Eb of a nucleus is the energy required to completely separate the nucleons. The origin of the binding energy may be understood with the help of mass-energy relation, D D E mc = 2,where Dmis the difference between the total mass of the separated nucleons and the mass of the stable nucleus. The mass of the stable nucleus is less than the sum of the mass of its nucleons. The binding energy of a nuclide Z A X is thus, E Zm A Z m m c b P N X = + [ ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ] 2 \u2026(i) where, mP = mass of proton, mN = mass of neutron and mX = mass of nucleus 340 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  Note (i) Dm Zm A Z m m P N X = + [ ( \u2013 ) \u2013 ] is called the mass defect. This much mass is lost during the formation of a nucleus. Energy D D E m c = ( ) 2 is liberated during the making of the nucleus. This is the energy due to which nucleons are bound together. So, to break the nucleus in its constituent nucleons this much energy has to be given to the nucleus. (ii) Stability : Although nuclides with Z values upto Z = 92 (uranium) occur naturally, not all of these are stable. The nuclide 83 209Bi is the heaviest stable nucleus. Even though uranium is not stable, however, its long lived isotope 238U, has a half-life of some 4 billion year. Binding energy per nucleon If the binding energy of a nucleus is divided by its mass number, the binding energy per nucleon is obtained. A plot of binding energy per nucleon E A b / as a function of mass number A for various stable nuclei is shown in figure. Note That it is the binding energy per nucleon which is more important for stability of a nucleus rather than the total binding energy. Following conclusions can be drawn from the above graph. 1. The greater the binding energy per nucleon the more stable is the nucleus. The curve reaches a maximumof about 8.75 MeV in the vicinity of 26 56 Fe and then gradually falls to 7.6 MeV for 92 238U. 2. In a nuclear reaction energy is released if total binding energy is increasing. Let us take an example. Suppose a nucleus X, which has total binding energy of 100 MeV converts into some another nucleus Y which has total binding energy 120 MeV. Then, in this process 20 MeV energy will be released. This is because 100 MeV energy has already been released during the formation of X while in case of Y it is 120 MeV. So, the remaining 20 MeV will be released now. Energy is released if SEb is increasing. 3. SEb in a nuclear process is increased if binding energy per nucleon of the daughter products gets increased. Let us take an example. Consider a nucleus X (AX =100) breaks into lighter nuclei Y ",

Binding energy per nucleon is increased if two or more lighter nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus. This process is called nuclear fusion. In nuclear fission a heavy nucleus splits into two or more lighter nuclei of almost equal mass. In both the processes E A b / is increasing. Thus, energy will be released. 34.6 Nuclear Fission (Divide and Conquer) As we saw in the above article nuclear fission occurs when a heavy nucleus such as 235U , splits into two lighter nuclei. In nuclear fission, the combined mass of the daughter nuclei is less than the mass of the parent nucleus. The difference is called the mass defect. Fission is initiated when a heavy nucleus captures a thermal neutron (slow neutrons). Multiplying the mass defect by c2 gives the numerical value of the released energy. Energy is released because the binding energy per nucleon of the daughter nuclei is about 1 MeV greater than that of the parent nucleus. The fission of 235 U by thermal neutrons can be represented by the equation, 0 1 92 235 92 236 n X Y + \u00be\u00ae \u00be\u00ae + + U U neutrons * where, 236 U* is an intermediate excited state that lasts only for10 12 \u2013 s before breaking into nuclei X and Y, which are called fission fragments. In any fission equation there are many combinations of X and Y that satisfy the requirements of conservation of energy and charge with uranium, for example, there are about 90 daughter nuclei that can be formed. Fission also results in the production of several neutrons, typically two or three. On the average, about 2.5 neutrons are released per event. A typical fission reaction for uranium is 0 1 92 235 56 141 36 92 0 1 3 n n + \u00be\u00ae + + U Ba Kr About 200 MeV is released in the fission of a heavy nucleus. The fission energy appears mostly as kinetic energy of the fission fragments (e.g. barium and krypton nuclei) which fly apart at great speed. The kinetic energy of the fission neutrons also makes a slight contribution. In addition one or both of the large fragments are highly radioactive and small amount of energy takes the form of beta and gamma radiation. 342 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics + + Fusion Fission A ",

In practice only a proportion of the fission neutrons is available for new fissions since, some are lost by escaping from the surface of the uranium before colliding with another nucleus. The ratio of neutrons escaping to those causing fission decreases as the size of the piece of uranium-235 increases and there is a critical size (about the size of a cricket ball) which must be attained before a chain reaction can start. In the \u2018atomic bomb\u2019 an increasing uncontrolled chain reaction occurs in a very short time when two pieces of uranium-235 are rapidly brought together to form a mass greater than the critical size. Nuclear Reactors In a nuclear reactor the chain reaction is steady and controlled so that on average only one neutron from each fission produces another fission. The reaction rate is adjusted by inserting neutron absorbing rods of boron steel into the uranium 235. Graphite core is used as a moderator to slow down the neutrons. Natural uranium contains over 99% of 238 U and less than 1% of 235 U. The former captures the medium speed fission neutrons without fissioning. It fissions with very fast neutrons. On the other hand 235 U (and plutonium-239) fissions with slow neutrons and the job of moderator is to slow down the fission neutrons very quickly so that most escape capture by 238 U and then cause the fission of 235 U. A bombarding particle gives up most energy when it has an elastic collision with a particle of similar mass. For neutrons, hydrogen atoms would be most effective but they absorb the neutrons. But deuterium (in heavy water) and carbon (as graphite) are both suitable as moderator. To control the power level control rods are used. These rods are made of materials such as cadmium, that are very efficient in absorbing neutrons. The first nuclear reactor was built by Enrico Fermi and his team at the University of Chicago in 1942.

This suggests a process that is the reverse of fission. When two light nuclei combine to form a heavier nucleus, the process is called nuclear fusion. The union of light nuclei into heavier nuclei also lead to a transfer of mass and a consequent liberation of energy. Such a reaction has been achieved in \u2018hydrogen bomb\u2019 and it is believed to be the principal source of the sun\u2019s energy. A reaction with heavy hydrogen or deuterium which yields 3.3 MeV per fusion is 1 2 1 2 2 3 0 1 H H He + \u00ae + n By comparison with the 200 MeV per fission of 235 Uthis seems small, but per unit mass of material it is not. Fusion of two deuterium nuclei, i.e. deuterons, will only occur if they overcome their mutual electrostatic repulsion. This may happen, if they collide at very high speed when, for example, they are raised to a very high temperature (10 10 8 9 - K). So much high temperature is obtained by using an atomic (fission) bomb to trigger off fusion. If a controlled fusion reaction can be achieved, an almost unlimited supply of energy will become available from deuterium in the water of the oceans. \u0098 Q-value of a nuclear reaction (optional) Consider a nuclear reaction in which a target nucleus X is bombarded by a particle \u2018a\u2019 resulting in a daughter nucleus Y and a particle b. a X Y b + \u00ae + Sometimes this reaction is written as X a b Y ( , ) The reaction energy Q associated with a nuclear reaction is defined as the total energy released as a result of the reaction. Thus, Q M M M M c a X Y b = + ( \u2013 \u2013 ) 2 A reaction for which Q is positive is called exothermic. A reaction for which Q is negative is called endothermic. In an exothermic reaction, the total mass of incoming particles is greater than that of the outgoing particles and the Q-value is positive. If the total mass of the incoming particles is less than that of the outgoing particles, energy is required for reaction to take place and the reaction is said to be endothermic. Thus, an endothermic reaction does not occur unless the bombarding particle has a kinetic energy greater than| | Q . The minimum energy necessary for such a reaction to occur is called threshold energy Kth. The threshold energy is somewhat greater than| | Q because the outgoing particles must have some kinetic energy to conserve momentum. Thus, K Q th >| | (in endothermic  reaction) Consider a bombarding particle X of mass m1 and a target Y of mass m2 (at rest). The threshold energy of X for endothermic reaction (negative value of Q) to take place is K Q m m th = + \u00e6 \u00e8 \u00e7\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8 \u00f7\u00f7 | | 1 2 1 344 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Extra Points to Remember E Y X Fig. 34.19  V Example 34.12 In the fusion reaction 1 2 1 2 2 3 0 1 H H He + \u00be\u00ae + n, the masses of deuteron, helium and neutron expressed in amu are 2.015, 3.017 and 1.009 respectively.

Classification of nuclei The nuclei have been divided in isotopes, isobars and isotones on the basis of number of protons (atomic number) or the total number of nucleons (mass number). Isotopes The elements having the same number of protons but different number of neutrons are called isotopes. In other words, isotopes have same value of atomic number ( ) Z but different values of mass number ( ) A . Almost every element has isotopes. Because of the same atomic number isotopes of an element have the same place in the periodic table. The isotopes of some elements are given below. Element Its isotopes Number of protons Number of neutrons Hydrogen 1 1 H 1 0 1 2 H 1 1 1 3 H 1 2 Oxygen 8 16 O 8 8 8 17 O 8 9 8 18 O 8 10 Chlorine 17 35 Cl 17 18 17 37 Cl 17 20 Uranium 92 235 U 92 143 92 238 U 92 146 In nature, the isotopes of chlorine (17 35 Cl and 17 37 Cl ) are found in the ratio 75.4% and 24.6%. When chlorine is prepared in laboratory, its atomic mass is found to be M = \u00b4 + \u00b4 = ( ) ( ) 35 37 0.754 0.246 35.5 Note Since, the isotopes have the same atomic number, they have the same chemical properties. Their physical properties are different as they have different mass numbers. Two isotopes, thus cannot be separated by chemical method, but they can be separated from the physical methods. Isobars The elements having the same mass number( ) A but different atomic number( ) Z are called isobars. They have different places in periodic table. Their chemical (as well as physical) properties are different. 1 3 2 3 8 17 9 17 H and He O and F , are examples of isobars. Isotones Elements having the equal number of neutrons ( \u2013 ) A Z are called isotones. 3 7 4 8 1 3 2 4 Li and Be H and He , are examples of isotones. 2. Nuclear forces In nucleus the positively charged protons and the uncharged neutrons are held together in an extremely small space( ) \u00bb - 10 15 m in spite of the strong electrostatic repulsion between the protons. Obviously, there are some strong attractive forces operating within the nucleus between the nucleons. The nuclear forces are non-electric and non gravitational forces. These forces are extremely short-range forces. They become operative only when the distance between two nucleons is a small multiple of10 15 - m. They do not exist when the distance is appreciably larger than10 15 - m and become repulsive when the distance is appreciably smaller than 10 15 - m. Nuclear forces 348 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  between protons and protons between neutrons and neutrons and between protons and neutrons are all essentially the same in magnitude. Thus, we can say that nuclear forces are charge independent. Yukawa\u2019s meson theory of nuclear forces A Japanese scientist Yukawa in 1935 suggested that the nuclear forces are \u2018exchange forces. Which are produced by the exchange of new particles called p-mesons between nucleons. These particles were later on actually discovered in cosmic radiation. There are three types of p-mesons, p p + - , and p0. There is a continuous exchange of p-mesons between protons and neutrons due to which they continue to be converted into one another. When a p+ -meson jumps from a proton to a neutron, the proton is converted into a neutron and the neutron is converted into a proton. p n - \u00be\u00ae + p and n p + \u00be\u00ae + p Conversely, when a p-- meson jumps from a neutron to a proton, then neutron is converted into a proton and the proton is converted into a neutron. Thus, n p - \u00be\u00ae - p and p n + \u00be\u00ae - p The exchange of p+ and p-- mesons between protons and neutrons is responsible for the origin of nuclear forces between them. Similarly, nuclear forces between two protons and between two neutrons are generated by a continuous exchange of p0-mesons between them. Thus, the basis of nuclear forces is the exchange of mesons and hence these are called \u2018exchange forces\u2019. 3. Size and shape of the nucleus The Rutherford scattering experiment established that mass of an atom is concentrated within a small positively charged region at the centre which is called the nucleus of the atom. The nuclear radius is given by R R A = / 0 1 3 Here, A is the mass number of the particular nucleus and R0 =1.3 fm (fermi) = \u00b4 - 1.3 10 15 m. This means that the nucleus radius is of the order of10 15 - m. Here,R0 =1.3 fm is the distance of closest approach to the nucleus and is also known as nuclear unit radius. 4. Nuclear density Let us consider the nucleus of an atom having the mass number A. Mass of nucleus 1.67 kg \u00bb \u00b4 \u00b4 - A 10 27 Volume of the nucleus = 4 3 3 pR = = / 4 3 4 3 0 1 3 3 0 3 p p ( ) ",

Magic numbers We know that the electrons in an atom are grouped in \u2018shells\u2019 and \u2018sub-shells\u2019. Atoms with 2, 10, 18, 36, 54 and 86 electrons have all of their shells completely filled. Such atoms are unusually stable and chemically inert. A similar situation exists with nuclei also. Nuclei having 2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82 and 126 nucleons of the same kind (either protons or neutrons) are more stable than nuclei of neighbouring mass numbers. These numbers are called as \u2018magic numbers\u2019. Chapter 34 Modern Physics - II \u0097 349  6. Fundamental particles The particles which are not constituted by any other particles are called fundamental particles. A brief discussion of important fundamental particles is as follows. (i) Electron It was discovered in 1897 by Thomson. Its charge is -e and mass is 9.1 \u00b4 - 10 31 kg. Its symbol is e - (or -1 0 b ). (ii) Proton It was discovered in 1919 by Rutherford in artificial nuclear disintegration. It has a positive charge + e and its mass is 1836 times ( ) 1.673 kg \u00b4 - 10 27 the mass of electron. In free state, the proton is a stable particle. Its symbol is p+. It is also written as 1 1 H . (iii) Neutron It was discovered in 1932 by Chadwick. Electrically, it is a neutral particle. Its mass is 1839 times( ) 1.675 kg \u00b4 - 10 27 the mass of electron. In free state the neutron is unstable (mean life \u00bb 17 minutes) but it constitutes a stable nucleus with the proton. Its symbol is n or 0 1 n . (iv) Positron It was discovered by Anderson in 1932. It is the antiparticle of electron, i.e. its charge is +e and its mass is equal to that of the mass of electron. Its symbol is e + (or +1 0 b ). (v) Antiproton It is the antiparticle of proton. It was discovered in 1955. Its charge is -e and its mass is equal to that of the mass of proton. Its symbol is p-. (vi) Antineutron It was discovered in 1956. It has no charge and its mass is equal to the mass of neutron. The only difference between neutron and antineutron is that if they spin in the same direction, their magnetic momenta will be in opposite directions. The symbol for antineutron isn. (vii) Neutrino and antineutrino The existence of these particles was predicted in 1930 by Pauli while explaining the emission of b-particles from radioactive nuclei, but these particles were actually observed experimentally in 1956. Their rest mass and charge are both zero but they have energy and momentum. These are mutually antiparticles of each other. They have the symboln and n. (viii) Pi-mesons The existence of pi-mesons was predicted by Yukawa in 1935, but they were actually discovered in 1947 in cosmic rays. Nuclear forces are explained by the exchange of pi-mesons between the nucleons. pi-mesons are of three types, positive p-mesons( ) p+ , negative pi-mesons ( ) p- and neutral p-mesons ( ) p0 . Charge on p\u00b1 is \u00b1 e. Whereas mass of p\u00b1 is 274 times the mass of electron. p0 has mass nearly 264 times the electronic mass. (ix) Mu-Mesons These were discovered in 1936 by Anderson and Neddermeyer. These are found in abundance in the cosmic rays at the ground level. There are two types of mu-mesons. Positive mu-meson ( ) m + and negative mu-meson ( ) m - . There is no neutral mu-meson. Both the mu-mesons have the same rest mass 207 times the rest mass of the electron. (x) Photon These are bundles of electromagnetic energy and travel with the speed of light. Energy and momentum of a photon of frequency n are hn and h c n , respectively. Antiparticles For every fundamental particle there exists an identical fundamental particle just opposite in some property. For example electron and positron are identical in all respects, except that charges on them are opposite. The following table shows various particles and their antiparticles. Some particles are their own antiparticles. For example p0 and g.

(i) conductors, (ii) insulators and (iii) semiconductors. In a conductor, large number of free electrons are present. They are always in zig-zag motion inside the conductor. In an insulator, all the electrons are tightly bound to the nucleus. If an electric field is applied inside a conductor, the free electrons experience force due to the field and acquire a drift speed. This results in an electric current. The conductivity of a conductor such as copper decreases as the temperature is increased. This is because as the temperature is increased, the random collisions of the free electrons with the particles in the conductor become more frequent. This results in a decrease in the drift speed and hence the conductivity decreases. In insulators, almost zero current is obtained unless a very high electric field is applied. Semiconductors conduct electricity when an electric field is applied, but the conductivity is very small as compared to the usual metallic conductors. Silicon, germanium, carbon etc., are few examples of semiconductors. Conductivity of silicon is about1011 times smaller than that of copper and is about1013 times larger than that of fused quartz. Conductivity of a semiconductor increases as the temperature is increased. \u0098 Before the discovery of transistors (in 1948) mostly vacuum tubes (also called valves) were used in all electrical circuits. \u0098 The order of electrical conductivity( ) s and resistivity r s = \u00e6 \u00e8\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8\u00f7 1 of metals, semiconductors and insulators are given below in tabular form.

The configuration is ( ) , ( ) , ( ) ( ) 1 2 2 3 2 2 6 1 s s p s and . The levels 1s, 2s and 2p are completely filled. The level 3s is half filled and the levels above 3s are empty. Consider a group of N sodium atoms all in ground state separated from each other by large distances such as in sodium vapour. There are total 11N electrons. Each atom has two energy states in 1s energy level. So, there are 2N identical energy states lebelled 1s and all them are filled from 2N electrons. Similarly, energy level 2p has 6N identical energy states which are also completely filled. In 3s energy levels N of the 2N states are filled by the electrons and the remaining N states are empty. 376 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Extra Points to Remember  These ideas are shown in the table given below. Table 35.2 Energy level Total available energy states Total occupied states 1s 2N 2N 2s 2N 2N 2p 6N 6N 3s 2N N 3p 6N 0 In the above discussion, we have assumed that N sodium atoms are widely spread and hence the electrons of one atom do not interact with others. As a result energy states of different states (e.g. 1s) are identical. When atoms are drawn closer to one another, electron of one atom starts interacting with the electrons of the neighbouring atoms of the same energy states. For example 1s electrons of one atom interact with 1s electrons of the other. Due to interaction of electrons, the energy states are not identical, but a sort of energy band is formed. These bands are shown in figure. The difference between the highest energy in a band and the lowest energy in the next higher band is called the band gap between the two energy bands. Thus, we can conclude that energy levels of an electron in a solid consists of bands of allowed states. There are regions of energy, called gaps, where no states are possible. In each allowed band, the energy levels are very closely spaced. Electrons occupy states which minimize the total energy. Depending on the number of electrons and on the arrangement of the bands, a band may be fully occupied or partially occupied. Now, electrical conductivity of conductors, insulators and semiconductors can be explained by these energy bands. Chapter 35 Semiconductors \u0097 377 3s 2p 2s 1s Total states = 2 Occupied = Empty = N N N Total states = 6 Occupied = 6 N N Total states = 2 Occupied = 2 N N Total states = 2 Occupied = 2 N N Fig. 35.1 } Conduction band Eg ~ 6 eV (b) } Valence band (a) Conduction band } Valence band } Eg ~ 1 eV (c) Conduction band } Valence band } Fig 35.2 Energy band diagram for a (a) metal, (b) insulator and (c) semiconductor. Note that one can have a metal either when the conduction band is partially filled or when the conduction and valence bands overlap in energy.  Conductors The energy band structure of a conductor is shown in figure (a). The last occupied band of energy level (called conduction band) is only partially filled. In conductors, this band overlaps with completely filled valence band. Insulators The energy band structure of an insulator is shown in figure (b). The conduction band is separated from the valence band by a wide energy gap (e.g. 6 eV for diamond). But at any non-zero temperature, some electrons can be excited to the conduction band. Semiconductors The energy band structure of a semiconductor is shown in figure (c). It is similar to that of an insulator but with a comparatively small energy gap. At absolute zero temperature, the conduction band of semiconductors is totally empty, and all the energy states in the valence band are filled. The absence of electrons in the conduction band at absolute zero does not allow current to flow under the influence of an electric field. Therefore, they are insulators at low temperatures. However at room temperatures some valence electrons acquire thermal energy greater than the energy gap Eg and move to the conduction band where they are free to move under the influence of even a small electric field. Thus, a semiconductor originally an insulator at low temperatures becomes slightly conducting at room temperature. Unlike conductors the resistance of semiconductors decreases with increasing temperature. We are generally concerned with only the highest valence band and the lowest conduction band. So, when we say valence band, it means the highest valence band. Similarly, when we say conduction band, it means the lowest conduction band. V Example 35.1 What is the energy band gap of : (i) silicon and (ii) germanium? Solution The energy band gap of silicon is 1.1 eV and of germanium is about 0.7 eV. V Example 35.2 In a good conductor, what is the energy gap between the conduction band and the valence band. Solution In a good conductor, conduction band overlaps with the valence band. Therefore, the energy gap between them is zero. 35.3 Intrinsic and Extrinsic Semiconductors As discussed above, in semiconductors the conduction band and the valence band are separated by a relatively small energy gap. For silicon, this gap is 1.1 eV and for germanium it is 0.7 eV. Silicon has an atomic number 14 and electronic configuration 1 1 2 3 3 2 2 6 2 2 s s p s p , , , , . The chemistry of silicon tells us that it has a valency 4. Each silicon atom makes covalent bonds with the four neighbouring silicon atoms. On the basis of bonds the atoms make with their neighbouring atoms, semiconductors are divided in two groups. Intrinsic Semiconductors A pure (free from impurity) semiconductor which has a valency 4 is called an intrinsic semiconductor. Pure germanium, silicon or carbon in their natural state are intrinsic semiconductors. As discussed above, each atom makes four covalent bonds with their neighbouring atoms. At temperature close to zero, all valence electrons are tightly bound and 378 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Si Si Hole Free electron Fig. 35.4 Si Si Fig. 35.3  so no free electrons are available to conduct electricity through the crystal. At room temperature, however a few of the covalent bonds are broken due to thermal agitation and thus some of the valence electrons become free. Thus, we can say that a valence electrons is shifted to conduction band leaving a hole (vacancy of electron) in valence band. In intrinsic semiconductors, Number of holes Number of free electrons = or n n h e = Extrinsic Semiconductors The conductivity of an intrinsic semiconductor is very poor (unless the temperature is very high). At ordinary temperature, only one covalent bond breaks in109 atoms of Ge. Conductivity of an intrinsic (pure) semiconductor is significantly increased, if some pentavalent or trivalent impurity is mixed with it. Such impure semiconductors are called extrinsic or doped semiconductors. Extrinsic semiconductors are again of two types (i) p-type and (ii) n-type. (i) p-type semiconductors When a trivalent (e.g. boron, aluminium, gallium or indium) is added to a germanium or silicon crystal it replaces one of the germanium or silicon atom. Its three valence electrons form covalent bonds with neighbouring three Ge (or Si) atoms while the fourth valence electron of Ge (or Si) is not able to form the bond. Thus, there remains a hole (an empty space) on one side of the impurity atom. The trivalent impurity atoms are called acceptor atoms because they create holes which accept electrons. Following points are worthnoting regarding p-type semiconductors. (a) Holes are the majority charge carriers and electrons are minority charge carriers in case of p-type semiconductors or number of holes are much greater than the number of electrons. n n h e >> (b) p-type semiconductor is electrically neutral. (c) p-type semiconductor can be shown as (ii) n-type semiconductors When a pentavalent impurity atom (antimony, phosphorus or arsenic is added to a Ge (or Si) crystal it replaces a Ge (or Si) atom. Four of the five valence electrons of the impurity atom form covalent bonds with four neighbouring Ge (or Si) atoms and the fifth valence electron becomes free to move inside the crystal lattice. Thus, by doping pentavalent impurity number of free electrons increases. The impurity (pentavalent) atoms are called donor atoms because they donate conduction electrons inside the crystal. Following points are worthnoting regarding n-type semiconductors, (a) Electrons are the majority charge carriers and holes are minority or number of electrons are much greater than the number of holes n n e h >> Chapter 35 Semiconductors \u0097 379 Al Si Fig. 35.5 \u2013 Hole or \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 \u2013 Fig. 35.6 P Si Fig. 35.7  (b) n-type semiconductor is also electrically neutral. (c) n-type semiconductor can be shown as Electrical Conduction through Semiconductors When a battery is connected across a semiconductor (whether intrinsic or extrinsic) a potential difference is developed across its ends. Due to the potential difference an electric field is produced inside the semiconductor. A current (although very small) starts flowing through the semiconductor. This current may be due to the motion of (i) free electrons and (ii) holes. Electrons move in opposite direction of electric field while holes move in the same direction. The motion of holes towards right (in the figure) take place because electrons from right hand side come to fill this hole, creating a new hole in their own position. Thus, we can say that holes are moving from left to right. Thus, current in a semiconductor can be written as, i i i e h = + But it should be noted that mobility of holes is less than the mobility of electrons. V Example 35.3 C, Si and Ge have same lattice structure. Why is C insulator while Si and Ge intrinsic semiconductors? Solution The energy gap between conduction band and valence band is least for Ge, followed by Si and highest for C. Hence, number of free electrons are negligible for C. This is why carbon is insulator. V Example 35.4 In an n-type silicon, which of the following statements is true? (a) Electrons are majority carriers and trivalent atoms are the dopants. (b) Electrons are minority carriers and pentavalent atoms are the dopants. (c) Holes are minority carriers and pentavalent atoms are the dopants. (d) Holes are majority carriers and trivalent atoms are the dopants. Solution (c) Holes are minority charge carriers and pentavalent atoms are the dopants in an n -type silicon. 380 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics + + or + + + Fig. 35.8 Si Si Al E Fig. 35.9  V Example 35.5 Which of the statements given in above example is true for p-type semiconductors?

These crystals are cut into thin slices called the wafer. Semiconductor devices are usually made of these wafers. If on a wafer of n-type silicon, an aluminium film is placed and heated to a high temperature, aluminium diffuses into silicon. In this way, a p-type semiconductor is formed on an n-type semiconductor. Such a formation of p-region on n-region is called the p-n-junction. Another way to make a p-n junction is by diffusion of phosphorus into a p-type semiconductor. Such p-n junctions are used in a host of semiconductor devices of practical applications. The simplest of the semiconductor devices is a p-n junction diode. Biasing of a diode In a p-n junction diode, holes are majority carriers on p-side and electrons on n-side. Holes, thus diffuse to n-side and electrons to p-side. This diffusion causes an excess positive charge in the n region and an excess negative charge in the p region near the junction. This double layer of charge creates an electric field which exerts a force on the electrons and holes, against their diffusion. In the equilibrium position, there is a barrier, for charge motion with the n-side at a higher potential than the p-side. The junction region has a very low density of either p or n-type carriers, because of inter diffusion. It is called depletion region. There is a barrierVB associated with it, as described above. This is called potential barrier. Chapter 35 Semiconductors \u0097 381 (b) Forward biased junction p-n p n V ",

The polarity of this voltage can lead to an electric field across the p-n junction that is opposite to the already present electric field. The potential drop across the junction decreases and the diffusion of electrons and holes is thereby increased, resulting in a current in the circuit. This is called forward biasing. The depletion layer effectively becomes smaller. In the opposite case, called reverse biasing the barrier increases, the depletion region becomes larger, current of electrons and holes is greatly reduced. Thus, the p-n junction allows a much larger current flow in forward biasing than in reverse biasing. This is crudely, the basis of the action of a p-n junction as a rectifier. The symbol of p-n junction diode is (             ) Diffusion Current and Drift Current Because of concentration difference, holes try to diffuse from the p-side to the n-side at the p-n junction. This diffusion give rise to a current from p-side to n-side called diffusion current. Because of thermal collisions, electron-hole pair are created at every part of a diode. However, if an electron-hole pair is created in the depletion region, the electron is pushed by the electric field towards the n-side and the hole towards the p-side. This gives rise to a current from n-side to p-side called the drift current. Thus, I df \u00be\u00ae from p-side to n-side I dr \u00be\u00ae from n-side to p-side When diode is unbiased I I I df dr = = or net 0. When diode is forward biased I I df dr > or I net is from p-side to n-side. When diode is reverse biased I I dr df > or I net is from n-side to p-side. Characteristic Curve of a p-n Junction Diode (a) Circuit for obtaining the characteristics of a forward biased diode and (b) Circuit for obtaining the characteristics of a reverse bias diode. When the diode is forward biased i.e. p-side is kept at higher potential, the current in the diode changes with the voltage applied across the diode. The current increases very slowly till the voltage across the diode crosses a certain value. 382 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics n p V n p mA S + \u2013 V V n p mA S + \u2013 V Fig. 35.11  After this voltage, the diode current increases rapidly, even for very small increase in the diode voltage. This voltage is called the threshold voltage or cut-off voltage. The value of the cut-off voltage is about 0.2 V for a germanium diode and 0.7 V for a silicon diode. When the diode is reverse biased, a very small current (about a few micro amperes) produces in the circuit which remains nearly constant till a characteristic voltage called the breakdown voltage, is reached. Then the reverse current suddenly increases to a large value. This phenomenon is called avalanche breakdown. The reverse voltage beyond which current suddenly increases is called the breakdown voltage. V Example 35.6 Can we take one slab of p-type semiconductor and physically join it to another n-type semiconductor to get p-n junction? Solution No. Any slab will have some roughness. Hence continuous contact at the atomic level will not be possible. For the charge carriers, the junction will behave as a discontinuity. V Example 35.7 Find current passing through 2 W and 4 W resistance in the circuit shown in figure. Solution In the given circuit diode D1 is forward biased and D2 reverse biased. Hence, D1 will conduct but D2 not. Therefore, current through 4 W resistance will be zero while through 2W resistance will be, 10 2 5 = A. 1.

A p-n junction diode can work as an excellent rectifier. It offers a low resistance for the current to flow when it is forward biased, but a very high resistance when reverse biased. Thus, it allows current through it only in one direction and acts as a rectifier. The junction diode can be used either as an half-wave rectifier or as a full-wave rectifier. (i) p-n junction diode as half-wave rectifier A simple rectifier circuit called the half-wave rectifier, using only one diode is shown in figure. When the voltage at A is positive, the diode is forward biased and it conducts and when the voltage at A is negative, the diode is reverse biased and does not conduct. Since, the diode conducts only in the positive half cycles, the voltage between X and Y or across RL will be DC but in pulses. When this is given to a circuit called filter (normally a capacitor), it will smoothen the pulses and will produce a rather steady DC voltage. (ii) p-n junction diode as full-wave rectifier Figure shows a circuit which is used in full-wave rectification. Two diodes are used for this purpose. The secondary coil of the transformer is wound in two parts and the junction is called a Centre-Tap (CT ). During one-half cycle D1 is forward biased and D2 is reverse biased. Therefore, D1 conducts but D2 does not, current flows from X to Y through load resistance RL . During another half cycle D2 is forward biased and D1 reverse biased. Therefore, D2 conducts and D1 does not. In this half cycle also current through RL flows from X to Y. Thus, current through RL in both the half cycles is in one direction, i.e. from X to Y. 384 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics ",

For one-half cycle diodes D1 and D3 are forward biased and D2 and D4 are reverse biased. So, D1 and D3 conduct but D2 and D4 don't. Current through RL flows from X to Y. In another half cycle D2 and D4 are forward biased and D1 and D3 are reverse biased. So, in this half cycle D2 and D4 conduct but D D 1 3 and do not. Current again flows from X to Y through RL . Thus, we see that current through RL always flows in one direction from X to Y. Note Even after rectification ripples are present in the output which can be removed upto great extent by a filter circuit. A filter circuit consists of a capacitor. V Example 35.8 In half-wave rectification, what is the output frequency, if the input frequency is 50 Hz? What is the output frequency of a full-wave rectifier for the same input frequency? Solution A half-wave rectifier conducts once during a cycle. Therefore frequency of AC output is also the frequency of AC input i.e. 50 Hz. A full-wave rectifier rectifies both the half cycles of the AC output i.e. it conducts twice during a cycle. So, Frequency of AC output = \u00b4 2 frequency of AC input = \u00b4 2 50 =100 Hz Ans.

Then the output is (a) zero (b) same as the input (c) full-wave rectified (d) half-wave rectified Solution (c) During the half cycle when V V D M N > , 1 and D3 are forward biased. Hence, the path of current is MABPQDCNM. In the second half cycle, whenV V D N M > , 2 and D4 are forward biased while D1 and D3 are reverse biased. Hence, the path of current is NCBPQDAMN.

Such diode is used as a voltage regulator. The symbol of zener diode is shown in figure. Once the breakdown occurs, the potential difference across the diode does not increase even if, there is large change in the current. Figure shows a zener diode in reverse biasing. An input voltageVi is connected to the zener diode through a series resistance R such that the zener diode is reverse biased. If the input voltage increases, the current through R and zener diode also increases. This increases the voltage drop across R without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. Similarly, if the input voltage decreases the current through R and zener diode also decreases. The voltage drop across R decreases without any change in the voltage across the zener diode. Thus any increase/decrease in the input voltage results in increase/decrease of the voltage drop across R without any change in voltage across the zener diode (and hence across load resistance RL ). Thus, the zener diode acts as a voltage regulator. We have to select the zener diode according to the required output voltage and accordingly the series resistance R.

When light of energy greater than the energy gap falls on the depletion region of the diode, electron-hole pairs are generated. Due to the electric field of junction, electrons and holes are separated before they recombine. Electrons reach n-side and holes reach p-side giving rise to an emf. When an external load is connected, current flows. The magnitude of the photocurrent depends on the intensity of incident light. (b) Light Emitting Diode (LED) It is heavily doped p-n junction diode which under forward bias emits spontaneous radiation. LEDs that can emit red, yellow, orange, green and blue light are commercially available. These LEDs find extensive use in remote controls, burglar alarm systems, optical communications, etc. Extensive research is being done for developing white LEDs which can replace incandescent lamps. LED have the following advantages over conventional incandescent power lamps. (i) Long life (ii) Low operational voltage and less power (iii) No warm up time is required. So fast on-off switching capability. (c) Solar Cell It works on the same principle as the photodiode. It is basically a p n - junction which generates emf when solar radiation falls on the p-n junction. The difference between a photodiode and a solar cell is that no external bias is applied and the junction area is kept much larger for solar radiation to be incident because we require more power.

(iii) Collection Electrons are swept to n- side and holes to p-side. Thus, p-side becomes positive and n-side becomes negative giving rise to photovoltage.

What should be the value of series resistor R? Solution Zener current I Z should be sufficiently larger than load current I L. .

The n-p-n transistor has a p-type wafer between two n-type layers. Similarly, the p-n-p transistor has a n-type wafer between two p-type layers. p-n-p Transistor Figure shows a p-n-p transistor, in which a thin layer of n-type semiconductor is sandwiched between two p-type semiconductors. The middle layer (called the base) is very thin (of the order of1mm) as compared to the widths of the two layers at the sides. Base is very lightly doped. One of the side layer (called emitter) is heavily doped and the other side layer (called collector) is moderately doped. Figure (c) shows the symbol of p-n-p transistor. n-p-n Transistor In n-p-n transistor, p-type semiconductor is sandwiched between two n-type semiconductors. Symbol of n p n - - transistor is shown in figure (f). More points about a transistor A transistor is basically a three-terminal device. Terminals come out from the emitter, base and the collector for external connections. In normal operation of a transistor, the emitter-base junction is always forward biased and collector-base junction is reverse biased. Chapter 35 Semiconductors \u0097 389 n (d) Emitter Base Collector p n (e) Emitter Base Collector Base Collector Emitter (f) Fig. 35.27 p (a) Emitter Base Collector n p (b) Emitter Base Collector Base Collector Emitter (c) Fig. 35.26  The arrow on the emitter-base line shows the direction of current between emitter and base. In an n-p-n transistor for example, there are a large number of conduction electrons in the emitter and a large number of holes in the base. If the junction is forward biased the electrons will diffuse from emitter to the base and holes will diffuse from the base to the emitter. The direction of electric current at this junction is therefore from the base to the emitter. A transistor can be operated in three different modes. (i) Common emitter (or grounded-emitter) (ii) Common collector (or grounded-collector) and (iii) Common base (or grounded-base) In common emitter mode, emitter is kept at zero potential. Similarly in common collector mode collector is at zero potential and so on. Working of a p-n-p Transistor Let us consider the working of a p-n-p transistor in common base mode. In emitter (p-type) holes are in majority. Since, emitter-base is forward biased, holes move toward base. Few of them combine with electrons in the base and rest go to the collector. Since, base-collector is reverse biased, holes coming from base move toward the terminal of collector. They combine with equal number of electrons entering from collector terminal. Let us take an example with some numerical values. Suppose 5 holes enter from emitter to base. This deficiency of 5 holes in emitter is compensated when 5 electrons emit from emitter and give rise to ie. One out of five holes which reach the base combine with one electron entering from base (the equivalent current is ib ). Rest four holes enter the collector and move towards its terminal. On the other hand, 5 electrons which leave the emitter (as ie) come to the base, emitter and collector junctions. One electron of it goes to base and rest four to collector. These four electrons give rise to ic (the collector current) and combine with the four holes coming from the base, and thus circuit is complete. From the figure, we can see that, i i i e c b = + Note that ib is only about 2% of ie, or roughly around 2% of holes coming from emitter to base combine with the electrons. Rest 98% move to collector. 390 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics p n p ib ie ie ",

Few of them leave the base terminal (comprising ib ) and rest move to collector. These electrons finally leave the collector terminal (give rise to ic). Electrons coming from base and from collector meet at junction O and they jointly move to emitter, which gives rise to ie. Thus, here also we can see that i i i e b c = + Note that although the working principle of p-n-p and n-p-n transistors are similar but the current carriers in p-n-p transistor are mainly holes whereas in n-p-n transistors the current carriers are mainly electrons.

Whichever circuit configuration, the emitter-base junction is always forward biased, while the collector-base junction is always reverse biased. (a) Common base amplifier using a p-n-p transistor In common base amplifier, the input signal is applied across the emitter and the base, while the amplified output signal is taken across the collector and the base. This circuit provides a very low input resistance, a very high output resistance and a current gain of just less than 1. Still it provides a good voltage and power amplification.

Emitter of a transistor can be compared with the cathode of the triode, the collector with the plate and the base with the grid. Transistor has following advantages over a triode valve (i) A transistor is small and cheap as compared to a triode valve. They can bear mechanical shocks. (ii) A transistor has much longer life as compared to a triode valve. (iii) Loss of power in a transistor is less as it operates at a much lower voltage. (iv) In a transistor no heating current is required. So, unlike a triode valve, a transistor starts functioning immediately as soon as the switch is opened. In case of valves, they come in operation after some time of opening the switch (till cathode gets heated). Drawbacks of a transistor over a triode valve Transistor have following drawbacks as compared to valves. (i) Since, the transistors are made of semiconductors they are temperature sensitive. We cannot work on transistors at high temperatures. (ii) In transistors noise level is high.

Thus X = 0, when both A and B are zero. Now suppose potential at A is zero but at B is 5V, then D1 is forward biased. In this situation potential at X is also zero. Thus, X = 0when A = 0. Similarly, we can see that X = 0when B = 0. Lastly when potentials at both A and B are 5V, so that both the diodes are unbiased and there will be no current through R and the potential at X will be equal to 5V.

Integrated Circuits The short form of integrated circuit is IC. It is revolutionised the electronics technology. The entire electronic circuit (consisting of many passive components like R and C and active devices like diode and transistor) is fabricated on a small single block (called chip) of a semiconductor. Such circuits are more reliable and less shock proof compared to conventional circuits used before. The chip dimensions are as small as 1 1 mm mm \u00b4 or it could be even smaller than this. Depending on the nature of input signals, ICs are of two types. (i) Linear or analogue IC (ii) Digital IC Linear ICs process analogue signals which change over a range of values between a maximum and a minimum. The digital ICs process signals that have only two values. They contain circuits such as logic gates. IC is the heart of all computer systems. It is used in almost all electronic devices like, cell phones, televisions, cars etc. It was first invented in 1958 by Jack Kilky and he was awarded Nobel prize for this in the year 2000. Growth of semiconductor industry is very fast. From current trends it is expected that by 2020 computers will operate at 40 GHz and would be much smaller, more efficient and less expensive than present day computers. 2. Feedback amplifier and transistor oscillator In an amplifier, a sinusoidal input is given which gets amplified as an output. Hence, an external input is necessary to sustain AC signal in the output. In an oscillator, we get AC output without any external input signal. A portion of the output power is returned back (feedback) to the input (in phase) with the starting power. In other words, the output in an oscillator is self sustained. 3. In transistors, the base region is narrow and lightly doped, otherwise the electrons or holes coming from the input side (say emitter in CE-configuration) will not be able to reach the collector. Chapter 35 Semiconductors \u0097 403 Feedback network Transistor Amplifier Input Output Principle of a transistor amplifier with positive feedback working as an oscillator  V Example 1 Sn, C, Si and Ge are all group XIV elements. Yet, Sn is a conductor, C is an insulator while Si and Ge are semiconductors. Why ? Solution It all depends on energy gap between valence band and conduction band. The energy gap for Sn is 0 eV, for C is 5.4 eV, for Si is 1.1 eV and for Ge is 0.7 eV. V Example 2 Three photodiodes D1, D2 and D3 are made of semiconductors having band gaps of 2.5 eV, 2 eV and 3 eV, respectively. Which one will be able to detect light of wavelength 6000 A o ? Solution Energy of incident light E (in eV) = 12375 l ( ) in A o E = 12375 6000 eV or E = 206 . eV For the incident radiation to be detected by the photodiode energy of incident radiation should be greater than the band gap. This is true only for D2. Therefore only D2 will detect this radiation. V Example 3 What is the range of energy gap ( ) E g in insulators, semiconductors and conductors? Solution For insulators Eg > 3 eV, for semiconductors, Eg = 0 2 . eV to 3eV while for conductors (or metals) Eg = 0. V Example 4 n-type extrinsic semiconductor is negatively charged, while p-type extrinsic semiconductor is positively charged. Is this statement true or false? Solution False. Intrinsic as well as extrinsic semiconductors are electrically neutral. V Example 5 What is resistance of an intrinsic semiconductor at 0K ? Solution At 0K number of holes (or number of free electrons) in an intrinsic semiconductor become zero. Therefore, resistance of an intrinsic semiconductor becomes infinite at 0 K. V Example 6 Consider an amplifier circuit using a transistor. The output power is several times greater than the input power. Where does the extra power come from? Solution The extra power required for amplified output is obtained from the DC source. V Example 7 A piece of copper and the other of germanium are cooled from the room temperature to 80 K. What will happen to their resistance? Solved Examples  Solution Copper is conductor and germanium is semiconductor. With decrease in temperature resistance of a conductor decreases and that of semiconductor increases. Therefore resistance of copper will decrease and that of semiconductor will increase. V Example 8 A transistor has three impurity regions, emitter, base and collector. Arrange them in order of increasing doping levels. Solution The order of increasing doping levels is base > collector > emitter. V Example 9 Name two gates which can be used repeatedly to produce all the basic or complicated gates. Solution NAND and NOR gates can be used repeatedly to produce all the basic or complicated gates. This is why these gates are called digital building blocks. V Example 10 A change of 8.0 mA in the emitter current brings a change of 7.9 mA in the collector current. How much change in the base current is required to have the same change 7.9 mA in the collector current ? Find the values of a and b. Solution We know that, i i i e b c = + \\ D D D i i i e b c = + or D D D i i i b e c = - Substituting the given values of the question, We have Dib = - = ( . . ) . 80 79 01 mA mA Hence, a change of 0.1 mA in the base current is required to have a change of 7.9 mA in the collector current. Further, a = i i c e or D D i i c e = 79 80 . . = 099 . Ans. b = i i c b or D D i i c b = 79 01 . . = 79 Ans. V Example 11 A transistor is used in common-emitter mode in an amplifier circuit.

In modern communication systems, the information is first converted into electrical signals and then sent electronically. This has the advantage of speed, reliability and possibility of communicating over long distances. We are using these every day such as telephones, TV and radio transmission, satellite communication etc. Historically, long distance communication started with the advent of telegraphy in early nineteenth century. The milestone in trans-atlantic radio transmission in 1901 is credited to Marconi. However, the concept of radio transmission was first demonstrated by Indian physicist JC Bose. Satellite communication started in 1962 with the launching of Telstar satellite. The first geostationary satellite Early Bird was launched in 1965. Around 1970, optical fibre communication entered in USA, Europe and Japan. The basic units of any communication systems are shown in Fig. 36.1 The transmitter is located at one place. The receiver is located at some other place. Transmission channel connects the transmitter and the receiver. A channel may be in the form of wires or cables or it may be wireless. Transmitter converts message signals produced by the source of information into a form suitable for transmission through the channel. In any communication system, a non-electrical signal (like voice signal) is first converted into an electrical signal by a device called transducer. Most of the speech or information signal cannot be directly transmitted to long distances. For this an intermediate step of modulation is necessary in which the information signal is loaded or superimposed on a high frequency wave which acts as a carrier wave. \u0098 There are basically two communication modes : point to point and broadcast. \u0098 Point to point In this mode, communication takes place between a single receiver and transmitter. For example : telephonic call between two persons is a point to point communication. \u0098 Broadcast In this mode, there are a large number of receivers corresponding to a single transmitter. Radio and television are examples of this type of communication. 36.2 Different Terms Used in Communication System Following basic terminology is used in any communication system. Now let us discuss them in detail. Electrical Transducer As discussed earlier also a transducer converts a non-electrical signal (like a voice signal) into an electrical signal. Signal Any information in electrical form suitable for transmission is called a signal. Signals can be either analog or digital. Analog signals are continuous variations of voltage or current. Sine functions of time are fundamental analog signal. Digital signals are those which can take only discrete values. Binary system is extensively used in digital electronics. In binary system 0 corresponds to low level and 1 corresponds to high level of voltage or current. 416 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics Extra Points to Remember Information source Transmitter Transmission channel Noise Receiver Fig. 36.1 Block diagram of communication system  Noise Unwanted signals which are mixed with the main signals are referred as noise. Transmitter A transmitter makes the incoming message signal suitable for transmission through a channel. Receiver The signal sent by transmitter through channels is received by the receiver. Attenuation When the signal propagates from transmitter to receiver it loses some strength and it becomes weaker. This is known as attenuation. Amplification The signal received by receiver is weaker than the signal sent by transmitter (due to attenuation). The amplitude of this signal is increased by an amplifier. The energy needed for additional signal is obtained from a DC power source. Range This is the largest distance from the transmitter up to which signal can be received with sufficient strength. Bandwidth This is the width of the range of frequencies that an electronic signal uses on a given transmission medium. It is expressed in terms of the difference between the highest frequency signal component and the lowest frequency signal component. Modulation The low frequency message signals cannot be transmitted to long distances by their own. They are superimposed on a high frequency wave (also called a carrier wave). This process is called modulation. Demodulation This is reverse process of modulation. At the receiver end information is retrieved from the carrier wave. This process is known as demodulation. Repeater Repeaters are used to extend the range of a communication system. It is a combination of a receiver and a transmitter. Receiver (or a repeater) first receives the original signals, then amplifies it and retransmits it to other places (sometimes with a different carrier frequency). 36.3 Bandwidth of Signals Message signals (such as voice, picture or computer data) have different range of frequencies. The type of communication system depends on the bandwidth (discussed in the above article). Some frequency range and their corresponding bandwidth are given below. (i) For telephonic communication A bandwidth of 2800 Hz is required. As, the signals range from 300 Hz to 3100 Hz and their difference is 2800 Hz. (ii) For music channels A bandwidth of approximately 20 kHz is required. Because, the audible range of frequencies extends from 20 Hz to 20 kHz and their difference is approximately 20 kHz. (iii) For TV signals A TV signal consists both audio and video. A bandwidth of approximately 6 MHz is required for its transmission. 36.4 Bandwidth of Transmission Medium Like bandwidths of message signals different types of transmission media offer different bandwidths. Commonly used transmission media are optical fibres, free space and wire. The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) administers the present system of frequency allocations. (i) Coaxial cables offers a bandwidth of approximately 750 MHz. (ii) Optical fibres offers a frequency range of 1 THz to 1000 THz. Chapter 36 Communication System \u0097 417  (iii) Communication through free space (using radio waves) offers a bandwidth varying from few hundreds of kHz to a few GHz. These frequencies are further subdivided for various services as given in following table. Table 36.1 S.No. Service Frequency Bands 1. AM radio broadcast 540 1600 - kHz 2. FM radio broadcast 88 108 - MHz 3. Television 54 890 - MHz 4. Cellular Phones 840 935 - MHz 5. Satellite communication 37 6 425 . . - GHz 36.5 Propagation of Electromagnetic Waves or Communication Channels Physical medium through which signals propagate between transmitting and receiving station is called the communication channel. There are basically two types of communications. (i) Space communication (ii) Line communication As per syllabus, we are here discussing only space communication. Space Communication Consider two friends playing with a ball in a closed room. One friend throws the ball (transmitter) and the other receives the ball (receiver). There are three ways in which the ball can be sent to the receiver. (a) By rolling it along the ground (b) Throwing directly and (c) Throwing towards roof and then reflected towards the receiver. Similarly, there are three ways of transmitting an information from one place to the other using physical space around the earth. Line Communication (a) Along the ground (ground waves). (b) Directly in a straight line through intervening topographic space (space wave, or tropospheric wave or surface wave) and (c) Upwards in sky followed by reflection from the ionosphere (sky wave). These three modes are discussed below. (i) Ground Wave or Surface Wave Propagation Information can be transmitted through this mode when the transmitting and receiving antenna are close to the surface of the earth. The radio waves which progress along the surface of the earth are called ground waves or surface waves. These waves are vertically polarised in order to prevent short-circuiting of the electric component. The electrical field due to the wave induce charges in the earth's surface as shown in figure. As the wave travels, the induced charges in the earth also travel along it. This constitutes a 418 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics  current in the earth's surface. As the ground wave passes over the surface of the earth, it is weakened as a result of energy absorbed by the earth. Due to these losses, the ground waves are not suited for very long range communication. Further these losses are higher for high frequency. Hence, ground wave propagation can be sustained only at low frequencies (500 kHz to 1500 kHz). Space Wave Propagation or Tropospheric Wave Propagation Television signal (80 MHz to 200 MHz) waves neither follow the curvature of the earth nor get reflected by ionosphere. Surface wave or sky wave cannot be employed in television communication. Television signals can be reflected from geostationary satellite or tall receiver antennas. Height of Transmitting Antenna The transmitted waves, travelling in a straight line, directly reach the receiver end and are then picked up by the receiving antenna as shown in figure. Due to finite curvature of the earth, such waves cannot be seen beyond the tangent points S and T. Suppose h is the height of antenna PQ. Let R be the radius of earth. Further, let QT ",

Sky Wave Propagation or Ionospheric Propagation If one wishes to send signals at far away stations, then either repeater transmitting stations are necessary or height of the antenna is to be increased. However much before the advent of satellites, radio broadcast covered long distances by the reflection of signals from the ionosphere. This mode of transmission is called ionospheric propagation or sky wave propagation. T \u00ae Transmitter, R \u00ae Receiver The ionosphere extends from a height of 80 km to 300 km. The refractive index of ionosphere is less than its free space value. That is, it behaves as a rare medium.

The bending of beam (away from the normal) will continue till it reaches critical angle after which it will be reflected back. The different points on earth receive signals reflected from different depths of the ionosphere. There is a critical frequency f c ( ) 5 100 to MHz beyond which the waves cross the ionosphere and do not return back to earth. Satellite Communication Long distance communication beyond 10 to 20 MHz was not possible before 1960 because all the three modes of communication discussed above failed (ground waves due to conduction losses, space wave due to limited line of sight and sky wave due to the penetration of the ionosphere by the high frequencies beyond f c). Satellite communication made this possible. The basic principle of satellite communication is shown in figure. A communication satellite is a spacecraft placed in an orbit around the earth. The frequencies used in satellite communication lie in UHF/microwave regions. These waves can cross the ionosphere and reach the satellite. For steady, reliable transmission and reception it is preferred that satellite should be geostationary. A geostationary satellite is one that appears to be stationary relative to the earth. It has a circular orbit lying in the equatorial plane of the earth at an approximate height of 36,000 km. Its time period is 24 hours. If we use three geostationary satellites placed at the vertices of an equilateral triangle as shown in figure. The entire earth can be covered by the communication network. In addition to geostationary equatorial orbits, there are two more orbits which are being used for communication. These are (a) Polar circular orbit This orbit passes over or very close to the poles. It is approximately at a height of 1000 km from earth. (b) Highly elliptical (inclined) orbits Chapter 36 Communication System \u0097 421 Ionosphere Transmitter Receiver Communication satellite Fig. 36.6 Principle of satellite communication Earth Satellite-2 Satellite-3 Satellite-1 Geostationary orbit Fig. 36.7 Polar orbit (circular) Highly elliptical (inclined) orbit Geostationary orbit(circular) Fig. 36.8 A schematic diagram of various satellite orbits used in satellite communication  Remote Sensing Remote sensing is an application of satellite communication. It is the art of obtaining information about an object or area acquired by a sensor that is not in direct contact with the target of investigation. Any photography is a kind of remote sensing. If we want to cover large areas for which information is required, we have to take photographs from larger distances. This is called aerial photography. Town and country planning can also be done by remote sensing. A satellite equipped with appropriate sensors is used for remote sensing. Taking photograph of any object relies on the reflected wave from the object. We use visible light in normal photography. In principle, waves of any wavelength in the electromagnetic spectrum can be used for this purpose by using suitable sensors. Some applications of remote sensing include meteorology (development of weather systems and weather forecasting), climatology (monitoring climate changes), and oceanography etc. 36.6 Modulation In this section, we will discuss in detail about modulation. What is it ? What is the need of modulation or how the modulation is done etc. No signal in general is a single frequency signal but it spreads over a range of frequencies called the signal bandwidth. Suppose we wish to transmit an electronic signal in the Audio Frequency (20 Hz-20 kHz) range over a long distance. Can we do it ? No it cannot because of the following problems. (i) Size of antenna For transmitting a signal we need an antenna. This antenna should have a size comparable to the wavelength of the signal. For an electromagnetic wave of frequency 20 kHz, the wavelength is 15 km. Obviously such a long antenna is not possible and hence direct transmission of such signal is not practical. (ii) Effective power radiated by antenna Power radiated by an antenna \u00b5 \u00d7 1 2 ( ) l Therefore, power radiated by large wavelength would be small. For good transmission, we require high power and hence need of high frequency transmission is required. (iii) Mixing up of signal from different transmitters Another problem in transmitting baseband signals directly is of intermixing of different signals. Suppose many people are talking at the same time or many transmitters are transmitting baseband information signals simultaneously. All these signals will get mixed and there is no simple way to distinguish between them. A possible solution to all above problems is using communication at high frequencies and allotting a band of frequencies to each message signal for its transmission. Thus in the process of modulation the original low frequency information signal is attached with the high frequency carrier wave. The carrier wave may be continuous (sinusoidal) or in the form of pulses as shown in figure. 422 \u0097 Optics and Modern Physics (a) Sinusoidal Time period T Time w =2p T Amplitude (b) Pulse shaped signals Pulse amplitude Pulse duration Pulse rise Pulse fall Fig. 36.9  Modulation Types Different types of modulation depend upon the specific characteristic of the carrier wave which is being varied in accordance with the message signal. We know that a sinusoidal carrier wave can be expressed as E E t = + f 0 sin ( ) w The three distinct characteristics are Amplitude ( ) E0 , angular frequency ( ) w and phase angle ( ) f . Either of these three characteristics can be varied in accordance with the signal. The three types of modulation are, amplitude modulation, frequency modulation and phase modulation. Similarly, the characteristics of a pulse are, Pulse amplitude, pulse duration or pulse width and pulse position (time of rise or fall of the pulse amplitude). Hence, different types of pulse modulation are, Pulse Amplitude Modulation (PAM), Pulse Duration Modulation (PDM) or Pulse Width Modulation (PWM) and Pulse Position Modulation (PPM). In this chapter, we shall confine to amplitude modulation (of continuous wave or sinusoidal wave) only. 36.7 Amplitude Modulation In this type of modulation, the amplitude of the carrier signal varies in accordance with the information signal. The high frequency carrier wave (Fig.a) is superimposed on low frequency information signal (Fig. b). As a result, in the amplitude modulated carrier wave, amplitude no longer Chapter 36 Communication System \u0097 423 1 0 \u201310 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 1 0 \u201310 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 (a) A sinusoidal carrier wave 1 0 \u201310 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 1 0 \u201310 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 1 0 \u201310 0.5 1 1.5 2 2.5 3 time (b) A modulating signal (c) Amplitude modulation (d) Frequency modulation, and (e) Phase modulation Fig. 36.10 Modulation of a carrier wave  remains constant, but its envelope has similar sinusoidal variation as that of the low frequency or modulating signal. The carrier wave frequency ranges from 0.5 to 2.0 MHz. AM signals are noisy because electrical noise signals significantly affect this. Let C A t c c = sin w represents a carrier wave and S A t s s = sin w represents the signal wave Then after making calculations we see that the modulated signal wave equation can be written as m A t A t c c c c s = + - sin cos ( ) w m w w 2 - + m w w A t c c s 2 cos ( ) ...(i) where,m = A A s c is called the modulation index. In practice, m is kept \u00a3 1to avoid distortion. In Eq. (i), w w c s - and w w c s + are respectively called the lower side and upper side frequencies. The modulated signal therefore consists of the carrier wave of frequency wc plus two sinusoidal waves each with a frequency slightly different from wc, known as side bands.

A simple method is shown in the block diagram of Fig.36.13. In the y function shown in block diagram there is a DC term C A A c s 2 2 2 ( ) + and sinusoids of frequencies w w s s , 2 , 2w w w c c s , - and w w c s + . As shown in block diagram, this signal y is passed through a band pass filter which rejects DC and the sinusoids of frequencies ws, 2ws and 2wc. After bandpass filter, the frequencies remaining arew w w c c s , - andw w c s + . The output (AM wave) of the band pass filter therefore is of the same form as Eq. (i) of previous article. It is further to be noticed that this modulated signal cannot be transmitted as such. This signal is passed through a power amplifier and then the signal is fed to transmitter antenna. 36.9 Detection of Amplitude Modulated Wave Signal received from the receiving antenna is first passed through an amplifier because the signal becomes weak in travelling from transmitting antenna to receiving antenna. For further processing, the signal is passed through intermediate frequency (IF) stage preceding the detection. At this stage, the carrier frequency is usually changed to a lower frequency. The output signal from detector may not be strong enough. So, it is further passed through an amplifier for final use. The block diagram of all steps is shown in Fig. 36.14.

Solution Transponder. V Example 2 An electromagnetic wave of frequency 28 MHz passes through the lower atmosphere of Earth and gets incident on the ionosphere. Shall the ionosphere reflects these waves? Solution Yes. The ionosphere reflects back electromagnetic waves of frequency less than 30 MHz. V Example 3 Which waves constitute amplitude-modulated band? Solution Electromagnetic waves of frequency less than 30 MHz constitute amplitude-modulated band. V Example 4 Give the frequency ranges of the following (i) High frequency band (HF) (ii) Very high frequency band (VHF) (iii) Ultra high frequency band (UHF) (iv) Super high frequency band (SHF). Solution (i) 3 MHz to 30 MHz (ii) 30 MHz to 300 MHz (iii) 300 MHz to 3000 MHz (iv) 3000 MHz to 30,000 MHz. V Example 5 State the two functions performed by a modem. Solution (i) Modulation (ii) Demodulation. V Example 6 Why is the transmission of signals using ground waves restricted up to a frequency of 1500 kHz? Solution This is because at frequencies higher than 1500 kHz, there is an increase in the absorption of signal by the ground. V Example 7 How does the effective power radiated by an antenna vary with wavelength? Solution Power radiated by an antenna \u00b5 \u00e6 \u00e8\u00e7 \u00f6 \u00f8\u00f7 1 2 l . V Example 8 Why is it necessary to use satellites for long distance TV transmission? Solution Television signals are not properly reflected by the ionosphere. So, reflection is affected by satellites. V Example 9 Why long distance radio broadcasts use shortwave bands? Solution This is because ionosphere reflects waves in these bands. V Example 10 What is a channel bandwidth? Solution Channel bandwidth is the range of frequencies that a system can transmit with efficient fidelity. Solved Examples  V Example 11 Give any one difference between FAX and e-mail systems of communication. Solution Electronic reproduction of a document at a distant place is known as FAX. In e-mail system, message can be created, processed and stored. Such facilities are not there in Fax system. V Example 12 Why ground wave propagation is not suitable for high frequency? Solution At high frequency, the absorption of the signal by the ground is appreciable. So, ground wave propagation is not suitable for high frequency. V Example 13 What is the purpose of modulating a signal in transmission? Solution A low frequency signal cannot be transmitted to long distances because of many practical difficulties. On the other hand, effective transmission is possible at high frequencies. So, modulation is always done in communication systems. V Example 14 What is a transducer? Solution A device which converts energy in one form to another is called a transducer. V Example 15 Why do we need a higher bandwidth for transmission of music compared to that for commercial telephone communication? Solution As compared to speech signals in telephone communication, the music signals are more complex and correspond to higher frequency range. V Example 16 From which layer of the atmosphere, radio waves are reflected back? Solution The electromagnetic waves of radio frequencies are reflected by ionosphere. V Example 17 Why sky waves are not used in the transmission of television signals? Solution The television signals have frequencies in 100-200 MHz range. As the ionosphere cannot reflect radio waves of frequency greater than 40 MHz back to the earth, the sky waves cannot be used in the transmission of TV signals. V Example 18 Why are short waves used in long distance broadcasts? Solution The short waves (wavelength less than 200 m or frequencies greater than 1,00 kHz) are absorbed by the earth due to their high frequency but are effectively reflected by Flayer in ionosphere. After reflection from the ionosphere, the short waves reach the surface of earth back only at a large distance from the transmitter. For this reason, short waves are used in long distance transmission. V Example 19 Define the term critical frequency in relation to sky wave propagation of electromagnetic waves. Solution The highest value of the frequency of radio waves, which on being radiated towards the ionosphere at some angle are reflected back to the earth is called critical frequency.

(b) m > 1 will result in overlapping of both sidebands resulting into loss of information. (c) m > 1 will result in change in phase between carrier signal and message signal.

Convex lens can make real, inverted and diminished size or real inverted and magnified or virtual, erect and magnified images of real objects. Rest type of cases are possible with virtual, objects. Subjective Questions 1. First draw a ray AA\u00a2 until it intersects with the principal optical axis and find the centre of the lens C. Since, the virtual image is magnified, the lens is convex. Draw a ray AB parallel to the principal optical axis. It is refracted by the lens so that it passes through its focus and its continuation passes through the virtual image. The ray A B \u00a2 intersects the principal optical axis at point F, the focus of the lens. 2. The paths of the rays are shown in figure. Since, the virtual image is diminished, the lens is concave. 3. (a) OA = 8.0 cm \\ ",

Penetrating power is maximum for g-rays, then of b-particles and then a-particles because basically it depends on the velocity. However, ionization power is in reverse order. 3. Both the beta rays and the cathode rays are made up of electrons. So, only option (a) is correct. (b) Gamma rays are electromagnetic waves. (c) Alpha particles are doubly ionized helium atoms and (d) Protons and neutrons have approximately the same mass. Therefore, (b), (c) and (d) are wrong options. 4. During b-decay, a neutron is transformed into a proton and an electron.

Hole diffusion from p to n side can be viewed as \u201celectron diffusion\u201d from n to p side. Diffusion occurs due to difference in concentrations in different regions. An electron (or hole) diffuses where its concentration is less. 2. Due to forward biasing depletion layer thickness decreases, potential barrier is reduced and diffusion of electrons from n to p side occurs. 1. In a transistor, base must be very thin and lightly doped so that all of the charge carriers are not combined in base and majority of them passes the reverse bias layer to collector side. 2. Voltage gain is maximum and constant for mid frequency range but is less for both low and high frequencies. (b) We construct truth table to see the logical operation. A B ",

With increase in temperature, number of electrons reaching conduction band increases but, mean relation time decreases. Effect of decrease in relation time is much less than that of increase in number density of charge carriers. 2. For diode D1, V V p n - = - - = - 10 0 10V So, D1 is in reverse bias. For diode D2, V V p n - = - - = 0 10 10 ( ) V So, D2 is in forward bias. 3. Hole is a vacancy created by an electron moving from valance band to conduction band. 4. Capacitor is charged to maximum potential difference \\ V V V = = \u00b4 max rms 2 = 220 2 volts 5. Electrons take the energy and move up to neat higher energy level both in conduction and valance band. So, a hole move downwards due to movement of electron. 6. In an n p n - - transistor, Electrons move from emitter to base and electrons which are not combined with holes in base region, crosses to collector side. 7. In an n p n - - transistor, I I I E B C = + As I I C E = 95 100 \u00de I I E C = \u00b4 100 95 = \u00b4 100 95 10 mA = 10.53 mA So, IB = 0.53 mA 8. Depletion zone is formed due to diffusion of e- from n to p side. Due to diffusion positive immobile ions exists on n side and negative ions on p-side. Recombination of e- and holes takes place on p-side. This results in (n-sidemore positive than p-side) formation of a junction field and potential barrier across the depletion zone. 9. When applied voltage approaches zener potential diode breakdown to conduct excess current. This causes a change of current in series resistance. 10. Reverse breakdown may be \u201cAvlanche break down\u201d (breakdown due to high velocity collision of minority carrier) or it may be a zener breakdown (breakdown of bonds due to strong field). 11. No, it cannot be measured by using a voltmeter. Barrier potential is less than 0.2 V for germanium diode and is less than 0.7 V for silicon. Also there are no free charge carriers which provide \u2018current\u2019 for working of voltmeter. 12. An \u201cOR\u201d gate may be made to operate motor relays for garage gates.
